FOREWORD 

I am pleased to present the Initial Biennial Update Report 
(BUR) of Mongolia under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 

As one of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of 
climate change, Mongolia demonstrates a strong solidarity 
to contribute to the ultimate objective of UNFCCC by 
submitting its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 
(INDC) and ratifying Paris Agreement in 2015 and 2016 
respectively. Mongolia has been actively communicating to 
regional and international dialogues to resolve the financial, 
technical and capacity challenges, along with strengthening 
the institutional capacity to build the robust mechanism to combating climate change. 

The Initial BUR has updated the information contained in Mongolia’s Second National 
Communication (SNC 2010) and National Inventory Report is being developed. First time 
Mongolia has set up the project management unit and permanent staff to develop this 
report. This report is prepared genuinely by national expert teams. 

I believe that the information provided in this report will be practical resources for both 
national and international policy makers, donors and private sectors to mobilize potential 
resources of global climate initiatives.

Mongolia’s initial BUR would not have been possible without hard work and dedication 
of the BUR project team and national experts in articulating the report. Also, the other 
key ministries, agencies, stakeholders, research institutions and nongovernmental 
organizations contributions were essential for successful completion of the report,

Finally, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Global Environment Facility, 
Secretariat of UNFCCC and United Nations Environment Programme for providing the 
funds and methodological support for producing this report.

Mongolia’s Initial Biennial Update Report

CHAPTER 1

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The initial Biennial Update Report of Mongolia under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) offers updated information on climate 
change mitigation actions from Mongolia’s Second National Communication submitted 
to the UNFCCC in 2010. Furthermore, it acknowledges Mongolia’s efforts to mitigate 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions after the submission of the Intended Nationally 
Determined Contributions (INDC) to UNFCCC on September 24, 2015. The initial BUR has 
the comprehensive information on mitigation scenarios of GHG emissions from 2010 
till 2030 by assessing the key national policy documents in the contexts of sustainable 
development and environment that the Government of Mongolia has approved. 

National Circumstances 

Mongolia is the 19th largest country in the world with a surface area of 1,564,116 square 
kilometers. It is also the world’s second-largest landlocked country with mountains 
covering the northern and western regions and the Gobi Desert located in the south. 
Mongolia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, as of January 
2015 with a population of 3,057,778 with an average growth rate of 2.1%. Approximately 
69% (2,096,180) of the total population lives in cities, out of which about 67% (1,396,288) 
accounts for Ulaanbaatar only. Ulaanbaatar is the capital and the largest city of Mongolia.

Mongolia’s economic growth has been based on the production in mining and agricultural 
sectors. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Mongolia was USD 11.8 billion in 2015. The 
GDP value of Mongolia represents 0.02 percent of the world’s economy. GDP in Mongolia 
averaged to USD 3.79 billion from 1981 until 2015, reaching an all-time high of USD 12.55 
billion in 2013 and a record low of USD 0.77 billion in 1993 at the beginning of transition 
to the market economy. 

Since 1992, the Parliament has passed several laws, regulations and policy on 
environmental protection and most of them were amended in 2012 as a package. Some 
of the policy and legal documents related to climate change are listed below:

• Law on Environmental Protection (1995, amended in 2007, 2012), 

• Water Law (1995 amended in 2004, 2010 and 2012), 

• Forest Law (1995, amended in 2012 and 2013), 

• Law on Air (1995, amended in 2012), 

• Energy Law (2001, renewed in 2015),

• Law on Waste, 2012, 

• Law on Renewable Energy, 2015,

• National Action Programme on Climate Change, 2000 ( updated in 2011),

• Green Development Policy, 2014 (2014-2030),

• Sustainable Development Vision 2030, 2016 (2016-2030),

• National Agriculture Development Policy, 2010 (2010-2021), 

• State Policy on Energy, 2015 (2015-2030),

• State Policy on Forest, 2015 (2016-2030),

• State Policy on Industry, 2015 (2015-2030).

Executive Summary



Mongolia’s Initial Biennial Update Report

CHAPTER 1

The other important document pursuant to climate change is INDC. Mongolia INDC 
has outlined a series of policies and measures that the country commits to implement 
until 2030 in the energy, industry, agriculture and waste sectors. The expected mitigation 
impact of these policies and measures will have a 14% reduction in the total national 
GHG emissions excluding Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) by 2030, 
compared to the projected emissions under a business as usual scenario. Those and 
other potentially more ambitious commitments are contingent upon gaining access to 
new technologies and sources of finance through internationally agreed mechanisms 
and instruments under the auspices of the UNFCCC.

The energy system is considered to be a major branch of the economy and infrastructure 
sector of Mongolia and it strongly influences the social and economic viability of the 
country. About 96% of domestically generated electricity is from coal-fired power plants 
while only 3% by renewable energy sources. 

Mongolia has an abundance of mineral resources and ranks as one of the world’s leading 
mining nations. The mining industry plays an important role in the country’s economy, 
accounting for 17% of GDP and 83% of export value in 2014. Over the last few years, 
mineral products have consistently accounted for more than 80% of the total export 
revenues, with copper and coal being the drivers of revenue.

Key manufacturing industries are the Cement and Lime industry which are the major 
contributors to GHG emissions. From 2011 onwards, the Cement and Lime production 
technology was changed from wet production technology to dry method technology.

The construction industry is also closely linked to other parts of the Mongolian economy, 
such as manufacturing, wholesale, retail, finance and insurance. 

According to the National Statistical Office (NSO), works carried out in 2014 totaled to 
MNT 2.2 trillion (USD 1.3 billion), up by 16.3% from the level in 2013. Much of this growth 
took place in the residential segment, which has been the focus of an increasing number 
of large-scale, state-led development projects in recent years. Despite the rapid year-on-
year jumps in construction output, the sector’s share of total GDP has remained relatively 
constant, at around 5%.

Due to a sparse population and geographically complex and large territory, the Mongolian 
transportation sector is of a strategic importance which consists of road, rail, air and 
water transportation and other sub-sectors. 

As of 2014, the total cargo traffic rail freight turnover was 63%, transportation 37%, 
total passenger automobile circulation 55%, while 22% and 23% was for rail and air 
transportation respectively. 

Mongolian crop-agriculture is primarily rain-fed which is possible in the short raining 
period in summer time. The extreme fluctuation in temperature and precipitation 
provides limited potential for agricultural development. Crops produced in Mongolia 
are wheat, barley, potato and about 30 other types of vegetables. The agriculture sector, 
therefore, remains heavily focused on livestock husbandry with about 80% of the land 
allocated to pasture. Only 1% of the land in Mongolia is cultivated with crops, amounting 
to the potential of 1.3 million hectares in 2016. Depending on the climate, soil structure

and fertility, the cultivation area is divided into five regions of different sizes.

The livestock-agriculture system has proven itself to be an efficient and sustainable 
means of utilizing available resources within the severe constraints of climate and limited 
natural productivity of the region. Livestock production is still the dominant economic 
activity for the majority of residents. The extensively managed pasture based livestock 
production system practiced by herders is a viable system that is well adapted to local 
conditions. 

Institutional Arrangements

The Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) of Mongolia is the key ministry to develop, 
update and implement climate related policies. Thus, the MET is the national entity with 
the overall responsibility for organizing and coordinating the compilation of National 
Communications, Biennial updated reports, GHG inventory and submitting them to the 
UNFCCC Secretariat to integrate climate change-related issues in various sectors. 

In 2015, the MET has set up Climate Change Project Implementation Unit (CCPIU) at 
the Nature Conservation Fund (name has changed as Environment and Climate Fund 
since 2017) engaging experienced professionals to facilitate smooth implementation of 
commitments under UNFCCC. The CCPIU is supervised by National focal point for the 
UNFCCC. There are three sectoral experts to conduct the GHG inventory. The major data 
provider is NSO (National Statistics Office). A number of other entities provide more 
specific data that is required for GHG estimation are not available at National Statistics, 
Such national entities include the Ministry of Energy (MoE), Ministry of Road and Transport 
Development (MRTD), Ministry of Agriculture and Light Industry (MoFALI), Ministry of 
Construction and Urban Development (MCUD), CDM Bureau, the National Renewable 
Energy Center, Ulaanbaatar Municipality, and National Customs Office. 

National Greenhouse Gas Inventory

The main sources of GHG emissions have been divided into the following sectors: Energy 
(CRF 1), Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU, CRF 2), Agriculture (CRF 3), Land use, 
Land use change and Forestry (LULUCF, CRF 4) and Waste (CRF 5). 

Total GHG emissions in Mongolia in 2014 were 34,482.73 Gg CO2e (excluding LULUCF). 
This represented 57.09% increase from the 1990 level of 21,950.73 Gg CO2e and 5.49% 
increase from the 2013 level with 32,687.27 Gg CO2e. Net GHG emissions in 2014 were 
10,030.80 Gg CO2e (including LULUCF). This represented 1,034.44% increase from the 
1990 level of -1,073.46 Gg CO2e and 23.23% increase from the 2013 level with 8,139.60 
Gg CO2e. 

In general, emission and removal from each sector increased in 2014 comparing to the 
base year and differences are showed in the Table by percentage changes and absolute 
values of each GHG inventory sectors.

GHG emissions in 2014 from the energy sector were 17,267.79 Gg CO2e accounting for 
50.08% of total national emissions. The second highest sharing of the total emission were 
from the Agriculture sector with 16,726.98 Gg CO2e accounting for 48.51%. Emissions 
from IPPU and Waste sector contributed 328.1 Gg CO2e (0.95%) and 159.91 Gg CO2e 
(0.46%) respectively to the national total in 2014 

Comparing to the 1990, sectoral emission increase for the Energy sector were 55.69%, for 
the IPPU sector were 50.03%, for the Agriculture sector were 58.02, for the Waste sector 
187.49% and removal for the LULUCF sector were 6.2% in 2014. 

Two main sources of the total emission were Energy and Agriculture sector for all years of 
the inventory. However, percentage share of emission sources were varied year by year 
depending on economic and climatic factors such as demand increase in energy sector 
and natural disaster occurrence in agriculture sector. 

Mitigation Actions and Effects

To assess overall mitigations actions to identify the future trends, the actions, policies 
and programs implemented or will be implemented through the national and sectorial 
policy framework and counter measures are considered. The assessment is based on the 
implementation of policies and programs which are implemented from 2007 to 2015. 
The key policies and actions are outlined to assess the future projections and current 
status of GHG mitigation actions and their effects. 

If the actions described on the national policies and programs are implemented 
completely, GHG emissions can be reduced by about 25 percent in 2025 and about 28 
percent in 2030. Due to lack of data availability on certain sectorial GHG emissions, the 
projected emission reduction could be higher. 

In 2030, GHG emissions in BAU scenario using 2010 as the base year is projected that 
2.7 times of reduction in energy sector, 5.0 times of reduction in cement production, 2.4 
times of reduction in livestock sector, 1.5 times of reduction in agriculture, 1.9 times of 
reduction in waste sector, while removal of follow land decreased by 2.1 times and forest 
removal potential is expected to increase. 

In 2030, GHG emissions by gases in BAU scenario using 2010 as the base year is projected 
that 3.3 times increase of carbon dioxide (CO2), 2.3 times increase of methane (CH4), 2.6

times increase of Nitrous oxide (N2O). 

Mongolia put the goal to reduce the GHG emissions by two percent from the current 
levels in 2020, by seven percent in 2025 and by 14 percent by 2030 by promoting the use 
of renewable energy sources and advanced technologies in liquefying and carbonating 
coal and shale. Increased energy efficiency and share of renewable energy are the two 
main approaches to policies and actions to mitigate GHG emissions. 

GHG emissions in 2030 expected to increase 2.4 times in energy need, 3.0 times in energy 
production, 2.7 times in overall energy sector compared to the level of 2010. 

The share of renewable energy percentage is reflected by net energy production and 
goals identified in the energy policies and programs. It is possible to reach the goals 
identified in the policies and programs if all planned activities of the projects will be 
implemented in their fixed timeframes. 

GHG emissions will be reduced in 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030 by 0.4, 2.7, 4.7, 7.2 mln 
t CO2e respectively if projects are fully implemented in the energy sector. 

Net GHG emission is projected to be reduced by 1.5 mln t CO2e in 2020 and by 2.8 mln 
t CO2e in 2030 through the improvement of energy efficiency. 

Domestic MRV mechanism

Recognizing the role of mitigation actions in reducing GHG emissions while simultaneously 
promoting country’s sustainable development objectives, Mongolia will advocate for a 
broader approach to MRV that establishes a robust mechanism in line with its commitment 
under the UNFCCC .The initial experience with different elements of the MRV for GHG 
emissions has already been gained through the implementation of Clean Development 
Mechanism (CDM) projects under the Kyoto Protocol. Moreover, significant effort has also 
been done under the preparation of the national GHG inventories, a crucial element of 
the overall MRV system. Mongolia has approved through its Agency of Standard and 
Metrology (MASM) ISO14064 and ISO 14065 standards as a national standard for MRV 
between 2012 and 2013. National renewable energy center (NREG) had become the first 
nationally accredited entity for MRV in 2014. 

Further, the MRV methods for project based activities is expected to evolve and be 
simplified, allowing the necessary information for emission reductions from individual 
activities to be collected from the already existing information in the GHG inventory and 
statistical data.

Constraints and gaps, and related financial, technical and capacity needs

Mongolia, as many other developing countries, has specific barriers for the implementation 
of adaptation and mitigation measures such as financial and technical resources, human 
and institutional capacity, and public support. The biggest problems facing the electricity 
and heat production sectors in reducing GHG emissions are the use of obsolete techniques 
and technologies, the low coal quality, and insufficient funds.

challenge for Mongolia. Most of the technologies applied in Mongolia’s energy sector 
are still out of date and have low efficiency and high energy losses. The heat content of 
the feedstock coal is low and variable, which leads to combustion problems and poor 
plant performance. A lack of appropriate technologies and know-how is the most urgent 
technical problem. 

Other key financial, technical and capacity barriers include a lack of support by financial 
institutions for renewable energy investments (particularly hydro power plants); lacks of 
domestic technological and technical resources for clean fuel production; and carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) plant.

Moreover, reporting of National Communications including GHG inventory and BUR is 
financed by GEF enabling activities through UNEP. In other words, there was no substantial 
government financing (except in-kind contribution) for these reporting requirements 
because of the economic difficulties in Mongolia, as the country is undergoing a 
transition period and the Government fails to resolve financing issues as required national 
circumstances and needs.

ARRANGEMENTS

1.1 National circumstances

1.1.1 Country profile

Mongolia is the 19th largest country in the world with a surface area of 1,564,116 square 
kilometers. It is also the world's second largest landlocked country with mountains 
covering the northern and western regions and the Gobi desert located in the south. 
Ulaanbaatar is the capital and the largest city of Mongolia.

Generally, average altitude in Mongolia is 1,580 m above the sea level. The highest point 
is the Khuiten Mountain peak (4,653 m) in the west and the lowest is the Khokh Nuur Lake 
in the east -518 m above sea level. Ulaanbaatar, the capital city is located at about 1,310 
m above sea level. The country is located in a transition zone at the crossroads of the 
northern Asia and Boreal Arctic regions where the Siberian Taiga meets the Asian deserts 
and steppe (Figure 1-1). Therefore Mongolia has diverse geographical features such 
as high mountains, forest steppe, the steppe and the Gobi desert regions. The unique 
features of these ecosystems are widely recognized in comparison with those of other 
countries in the same latitude of the northern hemisphere. Geographical features and 
the dry and cold climate are associated with fragility of natural ecosystems. The nature 
and the environment, the flora and fauna of the country are being changed significantly 
due to socio-economic stress as well as climate change.


Figure 1-1: Location of Mongolia



Mongolia’s Initial Biennial Update Report

National Circumstances and Institutional Arrangements

The Constitution and the 1992 Law on Government Administration proclaims Mongolia 
as a unitary state with three tiers of local Government. Governance of the administrative 
and territorial units is based on the principle of centralized authority as well as a 
gradual transition toward a system of local Governments. The country is divided into 
21 administrative units known as “aimags”. Aimags are further divided in to smaller 
administrative units “soums”, accordingly soums are also divided into smaller groups 
known as “bags” which is the lowest administrative unit in the country. 

Demography

Mongolia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, as of January 2015 
with a population of 3,057,778 with an average growth rate of 2.1% (Figure 1-2). Average 
life expectancy rate at birth is 69.9 (75.8 for women and 66.0 for men). While Mongolia 
as a whole is famously known as the world’s most sparsely populated nation, with a 
density of fewer than two people per square kilometer, according to the 2010 census, in 
Ulaanbaatar the figure is nearly 250 people per square kilometer. Urban area in Mongolia 
is defined in the Mongolia Law for Legal Status of Towns and Villages, as a settlement 
of over 15,000 people. The aimag centers inhabit about more than 15,000 populations 
compared to the urban category. About (2,096,180) 69% of total population lives in cities, 
out of which (1,396,288) about 67% accounts for Ulaanbaatar city only.

Figure 1-2: Population trend of Mongolia

Government

Mongolia is a democratic parliamentary republic. According to the 1992 Constitution, 
the President of the State is directly elected by all residents for a four-year term, eligible 
for a second term, and he/she presides over the army and the National Security Council. 

The unicameral legislature (State Great Khural) has 76 members, elected for a four-year 
term. After the legislative elections, the leader of the majority party or coalition chairs the 
Government. The Cabinet is established by the Prime Minister in consultation with the 
President and approved by the State Great Khural. Mongolia has four levels of governance 
– one central and three subnational tiers.

Economy

Mongolia’s economic growth has been based on the production in mining and agricultural 
sectors. While these sectors are still important, the services sector, including the banking, 
finance, and retail sectors, is making an increasing contribution to the growth in country’s 
economy. This trend mirrors the industrial profiles of most developed economies over 
recent decades.

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Mongolia was USD 11.80 billion in 2015. The GDP 
value of Mongolia represents 0.02% of the world economy. GDP in Mongolia is averaged 
at USD 3.79 billion from 1981 until 2015, reaching an all-time high of USD 12.55 billion in 
2013 and a record low of USD 0.77 billion in 1993.

Energy

Energy is one of the important aspects of the modern economy which makes the energy 
policy inseparable from the overall national developmental strategy. Per capita electricity 
in 2014 was 1,850 GWh which is 18% less than the Asia Pacific average (2,280 GWh/capita). 
In Mongolia, 60% of households are connected to the grid and 318 out of 330 soums are 
connected to transmission lines. Therefore, households of all aimags and 96% of soums 
are connected to the grid.

The power system is considered to be a major branch of the economy and infrastructure 
sector of Mongolia and it strongly influences the social and economic viability of the 
country. About 96% of domestically generated electricity is from coal fired power while 
only 3% by renewable energy sources. Three centralized power grids and two isolated

systems supply electricity: (i) Central Energy System (CES); (ii) Eastern Energy System (EES); 
and (iii) Western Energy System (WES). The two isolated systems are (i) Dalanzhadgad 
CHP plant and local grid, and (ii) Zhavhan and Gobi-Altai aimags.

There are seven main coal-fired power plants in Mongolia with a total installed capacity 
of 856.3 MW. Three large sized coal fired power plants are located in Ulaanbaatar. Coal 
demand of these power plants is met through state-run operations at Shivee-Ovoo and 
Baganuur coal mines.

In 2015, 5.3 billion kWh of electricity was generated by thermal power plants and 5323.5 
million kWh of electricity was generated by hydropower plants, 59.4 million kWh of 
electricity was generated by Wind Park, 5.8 million kWh of electricity was generated by 
solar PV (Table1.2). Moreover, 1.3 billion kWh of electricity was imported.

Currently, use of renewable energy sources for power generation has initiated the 
“100,000 Solar Ger” national program. Herders living in rural areas use solar panels for 
their electricity. In 2013, new wind park with a capacity of 50 MW has been constructed 
and providing electricity to the central grid. 

So far more than 70 large and middle-sized dams are proposed to be constructed in 
Mongolia, but only 2 of them have been built to date, namely, Durgun (12 MW) and 
Taishir (11 MW). Currently, hydroelectricity is produced by other 10 small plants. Most 
of the existing small hydropower plants have been constructed using water diversion 
channels; the installed capacity is relatively small. As none of these plants can operate in 
winter due to ice formation, the quoted production values are for the summer months 
only from May to October. Other two large hydro-dams such as “Egiin gol hydro-dam” 
and “Shuren hydro-dam” are under a plan to be constructed for more than ten years and 
have not been implemented due to transboundary water debate.

Mongolian forest, which covers 8.1% of the territory, is located in the southern border 
of the Siberian Taiga. However, Mongolian forest stretches for 2,000 km from the Altai 
Mountains in the west to Soyolz Mount of Ikh Khyangan Mountains in the east and also 
from Khuvsgul Mountains in the north to the Gobi steppe area in the south.

National Circumstances and Institutional Arrangements

Industry 

Mongolia has an abundance of mineral resources and ranks as one of the world’s leading 
mining nations. The mining industry plays an important role in not an only industrial 
sector but also the country’s economy, it is accounted for 17% of GDP and 83% of export 
value in 2014. Over the last few years, mineral products have consistently accounted 
for more than 80% of total export revenues, with copper and coal being the drivers of 
revenue.

Key manufacturing industries are the Cement and Lime industry which are the major 
contributors to GHG emissions. The Cement and Lime production is shown in Figure 1-4. 
From 2011 onwards, the Cement and Lime production technology was changed from 
wet production technology to dry method technology.

 

Figure 1-4: Cement and lime production

The construction industry is also closely linked to other parts of the Mongolian economy, 
such as manufacturing, wholesale, retail, finance and insurance. The construction 
industry undertakes activities related to three main categories: residential building such 
as apartments, and houses; non-residential building such as offices, shops, hotels, schools 
etc. and engineering construction like roads, bridges, water supply, sewerage, and mines. 
Construction activities are mainly carried out by private sectors. 

According to the National Statistical Office (NSO), works carried out in 2014 totaled 
to MNT2.2trn ($1.3bn), up by 16.3% on 2013. Much of this growth took place in the 
residential segment, which has been the focus of an increasing number of large-scale, 
state-led development projects in recent years. Despite the rapid year-on-year jumps in 
construction output, the sector’s share of total GDP has remained relatively constant, at 
around 5%.

Transportation

Due to a sparse population and geographically complex and large territory, the Mongolian 
transportation sector is of a strategic importance and it consists of road, rail, air and water 
transportation and other subsectors.

In recent years, the government has invested heavily in improving infrastructure, 
particularly, the national road network. As of late 2013, approximately 3,000 km of new 
roads were either under construction or in the midst of refurbishment, according to 
the NSO. The government is also in the final planning stages of an initiative aimed at 
extending the national rail system, which at present, consists of only a handful of major 
cross-country lines. By the end of 2018, the state hopes to have completed projects on 
1,800 km of new lines, which will be dedicated, at least initially, to carrying freight.

Agriculture

Mongolian crop-agriculture is primarily rain-fed which only occurs in the short raining 
times in summer. The extreme fluctuation in temperature and precipitation provides 
limited potential for agricultural development. Crops produced in Mongolia are wheat, 
barley, potato and about 30 other types of vegetables. The agriculture sector, therefore, 
remains heavily focused on livestock husbandry with about 80% of the land allocated 
to pasture. Only 1% of the land in Mongolia is cultivated with crops, amounting to the 
potential of 1.3 million hectares in 2016. Depending on the climate, soil structure and 
fertility the cultivation area is divided into five regions. Cereals can be cultivated in 75% 
of the total land and the yield per hectare (1,647 tons) is almost two times less than the 
world average (3,886ton). National cereal production meets about 90% and vegetable 
production meets more than 60% of demand. The agriculture sector engages with 1,190 
companies, and 34.5 thousand family-owned enterprises. Also more than 60% of the 
investment comes from private sectors (MoFALI, 2014).

The livestock-agriculture system has proven itself to be an efficient and sustainable 
means of utilizing available resources within the severe constraints of climate and limited 
natural productivity of the region. Livestock production is still the dominant economic 
activity for the majority of residents. The extensively managed livestock production 
system as practiced by herders is a viable system, well adapted to local conditions. It 
also presents both advantages and disadvantages relative to the economic development 
and conservation of wildlife and natural ecosystems. Animals raised commercially in 
Mongolia are horses, cattle, goats, sheep and camels. Livestock population is given in 
Figure 1-5. They are raised primarily for their meat, milk and traditional dairy products. 
Additionally, they are valued for their hair and skin. The livestock subsector accounts for 
almost 10% of export earnings, approximately 80% of the total agricultural production. 
About 26% of the work force and about 20% of households, more importantly, over 70% 
of employments in rural areas are directly engaged in the livestock sector providing food 
and goods to the remaining 3 million people. Livestock population is increasing from 
year to year.

Preparation of the BUR

Pursuant to the COP decisions on reporting requirements for non-Annex I Parties to the 
UNFCCC, Mongolia has prepared its first Biennial Update Report (BUR) as an update to the 
information provided in Mongolia’s Second National Communication.

Policy dimensions

Since 1992, the Parliament has passed several laws, regulations and policy on 
environmental protection and most of them were amended in 2012 as a package. Some 
of the policy and legal documents related to climate change are listed below:

• Law on Environmental Protection (1995, amended in 2007, 2012), 

• Water Law (1995 amended in 2004, 2010 and 2012), 

• Forest Law (1995, amended in 2012 and 2013), 

• Law on Air (1995, amended in 2012), 

• Energy Law (2001, renewed in 2015),

• Law on Waste, 2012, 

• Law on Renewable Energy, 2015,

• National Action Programme on Climate Change, 2000 ( updated in 2011),

• Green Development Policy, 2014 (2014-2030),

• Sustainable Development Vision 2030, 2016 (2016-2030),

• National Agriculture Development Policy, 2010 (2010-2021), 

• State Policy on Energy, 2015 (2015-2030),

• State Policy on Forest, 2015 (2016-2030),

• State Policy on Industry, 2015 (2015-2030).

The Environmental Protection Law says that the citizens, economic entities and 
organizations shall compensate for direct damage caused to the environment and natural 
resources as a result of their unlawful conduct. The law imposes stricter sanctions against 
officials for their non-compliance with certain provisions and requirements. It means 
that the subject liable to pay compensation for damage caused to the environment will 
undergo an assessment by an environmental inspector who will decide the value of the 
compensation.

The renewed Law on Air of Mongolia clearly recognizes the power of the state and local 
self-governing bodies, the right of citizens, and the organization that is in charge of air 
quality matters to determine air quality, measure and test, as well as compile relevant 
data. Also, the law acted the actions to reduce air pollution.

The purpose of Law on Forest is to regulate the interrelation of protection, possession, 
sustainable use and reproduction of the forest and forest fire protection in Mongolia.

The purpose of the Law on Waste shall be to govern relationships related to the collection, 
transportation, storage, and landfill of waste and reusing of waste as a source of raw 
materials to prevent from and eliminate hazardous impact of wastes on public health 
and environment.



Mongolia’s Initial Biennial Update Report

National Circumstances and Institutional Arrangements

The new Law on Soil Protection and Desertification Control was adopted to combat 
desertification and mitigate the effects of drought, reduce environment pollution, 
improve land productivity and rehabilitation of land, enable human health and safety life 
and to set up the liability mechanism.

In June 2014, the Parliament approved the Green Development Policy (GDP). The 
GDP was drafted by a working group within the Ministry of Environment and Green 
Development in response to the Rio+20 Conference in 2012. Two high level documents 
were prepared to formally establish the GDP: the Green Development Concept, and the 
Mid-term Programme on Green Development. The concept paper determines the goals 
and purposes for green development until 2030, whereas the Mid-term Programme 
designs policy and strategies to ensure these goals and purposes are implemented.

The National Renewable Energy Programme (2015) established a long term goal of total 
installed capacity generated from renewable sources by 2030. The Renewable Energy 
Law (2015) further regulates the renewable energy power generation. It provides a feed-
in tariff for the grid and the independent power generation from renewable energy. The 
new Law on Energy and Renewable energy target is to increase the share of renewable 
energy in total primary energy sources up to 20% by 2020, 25% by2025 and 30% by 2030.

Parliament also approved the Law on Hazardous and Toxic Chemicals (2006), the Law on 
Technology Transfer (1998) and the Law on Science and Technology (2006) to improve 
legal conditions for the transfer of modern technology for different sectors including 
transportation.

The Government has also introduced a number of action plans, including the National 
Action Programme on Climate Change, the Mongolian Environmental Action Plan, the 
National Action Plan to Combat Desertification, the National Biodiversity Action Plan, the 
Action Programme to Protect Air Quality, and the National Action Programme to Protect 
the Ozone Layer. 

The National Action Programme on Climate Change (NAPCC) is the most relevant 
policy document addressing climate change. It was approved by Parliament initially in 
2000 and upgraded in 2011 and aimed to meet UNFCCC obligations and commitments, 
establishing national policy and strategy to tackle the adverse impacts of climate change 
and to mitigate GHG emissions. The NAPCC is to be implemented in two phases. The 
first phase (2011-2016) aims to strengthen national mitigation and adaptation capacity, 
setting up the legal environment, structure, institutional and management system, 
and improving community and public awareness and participation in climate change 
activities. The second phase (2017-2021) aims to implement climate change adaptation 
and mitigation measures.

Mongolia has joined 14 environment related UN conventions and treaties, including the 
UNFCCC. Mongolia has submitted two National Communications and now preparing 
the third one. Mongolia has submitted NAMAs at the Conference of the Parties (COP) 15 
Meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark in December 2009. Mongolia expressed its intention 
to agree to the Copenhagen Accord, and subsequently Mongolia submitted a list of 
proposed NAMAs to the UNFCCC Secretariat in January 2010. In its list of NAMAs, Mongolia 
submitted 22 mitigation options in six sectors towards reducing GHG emissions.



Mongolia’s Initial Biennial Update Report

National Circumstances and Institutional Arrangements

The other important document pursuant to climate change is INDC. Mongolia INDC has 
outlined a series of policies and measures that the country commits to implement until 
2030, in the energy, industry, agriculture and waste sectors. The expected mitigation 
impact of these policies and measures will be a 14% (Figure 1-6) reduction in total 
national GHG emissions excluding land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) by 
2030, compared to the projected emissions under a business as usual scenario. Those 
and other potentially more ambitious commitments are contingent upon gaining access 
to new technologies and sources of finance through internationally agreed mechanisms 
and instruments under the auspices of the UNFCCC.

Figure 1-6: Indicative potential emissions reductions of the measures 
compared to BAU emissions

Institutional Arrangement

The Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) of Mongolia is the key ministry to develop, 
update and implement climate related policies. Thus, the MET is the national entity with 
the overall responsibility for organizing and coordinating the compilation of National 
Communications, Biennial updated reports, GHG inventory and submitting them to the 
UNFCCC Secretariat to integrate climate change related issues in various sectors. 

The former Ministry of Environment and Green Development has established 
interdisciplinary and inter-sectorial National Climate Committee (NCC), led by the 
Ministry of Environment and Green Development in order coordinate and guide national 
activities and measures to adapt to climate change and mitigate GHG emissions. High 
level officials such as Deputy Ministers, State Secretaries and Director-Generals of the main 
Departments of all related ministries, agencies and other key officials were designated as 
members of the NCC. However, due to frequent changes in the Government, so far this 
Committee was not able to function as it was intended initially. There is a plan to create 
more simplified but more workable coordination mechanism with combined duties 
consistent with the new Government structure. 

In 2016 given the importance of climate change adaptation and GHG mitigation, the 
MET has established “Climate Change and International Cooperation Department” 
merging mandate of the International Cooperation Division that was under State Policy 



Mongolia’s Initial Biennial Update Report

National Circumstances and Institutional Arrangements

and Administration Department of the MET and Climate Change Coordination Office to 
manage the implementation of the commitments and duties under the UNFCCC and 
the Kyoto Protocol, and to integrate climate change related issues in other development 
programmes.

In 2015, the MET has set up Climate Change Project Implementation Unit (CCPIU) at 
the Nature Conservation Fund (name has changed as Environment and Climate Fund 
since 2017) engaging experienced professionals to facilitate smooth implementation 
of commitments under UNFCCC. The CCPIU supervised by National focal point for the 
UNFCCC. There are three sectoral experts to conduct GHG inventory. The Institutional 
arrangement for climate change is shown in Figure 1-7.

The major data provider is NSO (National Statistics Office). A number of other entities 
provide more specific data that is required for GHG estimation which is not available at 
National Statistics. Such national entities include the Ministry of Energy (MoE), Ministry 
of Road and Transport Development (MRTD), Ministry of Food and Agriculture and Light 
Industry (MoFALI), Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MCUD), CDM 
Bureau, the National Renewable Energy Center, Ulaanbaatar Municipality, and National 
Customs Office.

for Meteorology and Environment Monitoring (NAMEM) monitors the environment and 
climate, carrying out a range of climate change studies and research. In addition, the 
government is promoting activities to raise public awareness of climate change and its 
impacts through professional and civil society communities and media.

BUR Implementation Arrangement 

The preparation of GHG inventory, national communications and Biennial Update Report 
are financed by GEF enabling activities through UNEP. Depending on activities or tasks, 
the MET appoints a project manager to undertake day to day coordination of the project. 
The preparation arrangement of the first BUR of Mongolia is illustrated in Figure 1-8. 

Figure 1-8: The First BUR implementation arrangement

For the improvement of the data collection and quality of GHG estimation, during the 
preparation of BUR, the MET of Mongolia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 
on data exchange with major line ministries including MoE, MoFALI, MoI, MRTD, and 
MCUD. The Director of Nature Conservation Fund (Project executing organization) signed 
MoUs with major institutes and agencies such as CDM Bureau, the National Renewable 
Energy Center, Ulaanbaatar Municipality, and National Customs Office in April, 2016.

The Government of Mongolia is continuously striving to improve national GHG estimation 
and reporting to the UNFCCC from INC to SNC and from SNC to the first BUR. To achieve 



Mongolia’s Initial Biennial Update Report

National Circumstances and Institutional Arrangements

continuous improvement in national reporting, Government of Mongolia has made 
institutional arrangements, specific for the nature and scale of the BUR preparation.

A number of institutions were engaged to conduct various studies for BUR, including 
those that especially carry out studies to identify constraints and gaps and related 
financial, technical and capacity needs, including information on financial support 
needed and received.

1.3 Financial, Technology and Capacity Needs 

According to decision 2/CP.17, non-Annex I Parties are to provide updated information 
on constraints and gaps, and related financial, technical and capacity building needs, as 
well as updated information on financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building 
and technical support received from the Global Environment Facility, Parties included 
in Annex II to the Convention and other developed country Parties, the Green Climate 
Fund and multilateral institutions for activities relating to climate change, including for 
the preparation of the current BUR.

Accordingly, this chapter presents information on the need for continued reporting of the 
GHG inventory under the Convention, and financial, technological and capacity building 
needs, constraints and finance received. The contents of this chapter should be read in 
conjunction with the information provided on technology and finance needs in SNC and 
TNC as the needs remain largely relevant for the present reporting as well.

2.1 National Greenhouse Gas Inventory System

2.1.1 Overview of institutional arrangements for compiling GHG inventory 

In accordance with Article 24 of the Law on Air (1995; 2012), the designated government 
authority shall estimate the emissions and removals of GHGs for Mongolia following 
the methodologies approved by the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 

The Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) of Mongolia is the key ministry to develop, 
update and implement climate related policies. Thus, the MET and its “Climate Change and 
International Cooperation Department” is the national entity with overall responsibility 
for organizing and coordinating the compilation of National Communications, Biennial 
updated reports, GHG inventory and submitting them to the UNFCCC Secretariat through 
the National focal point for the UNFCCC. 

In order to facilitate smooth implementation of commitments under UNFCCC, the MET 
established climate change project implementation unit (CCPIU) at the Environment and 
Climate Fund (ECF) under the ministry. The CCPIU is also supervised by National focal 
point for the UNFCCC.

The inventory team of CCPIU, which consists of three sectorial experts, with the 
cooperation of relevant ministries, agencies and organizations, prepares the national 
GHG inventory and compiles supplementary information. 

Figure 2-1 shows the overall institutional arrangement for Mongolia’s inventory preparation. 
More detailed information on the role and responsibility of relevant ministries, agencies 
and organizations in the inventory preparation process is described in the Table 2-1.

2.1.2 Overview of inventory preparation and management 

As described above, the Mongolia’s GHG inventory preparation system/institutional 
arrangement is not well developed, but in the near future it is planned to establish a 
national system for sustainable inventory preparation. Currently the preparation of 
national GHG inventory is centralized and is being compiled at CCPIU of ECF under the 
ministry. The improvement should be made in the near future is the decentralization 
of the inventory preparation process in terms of required activity data, and distribute 
the responsibilities of individual sectors fully under the external institutions and sectorial 
experts. Under the distribution of responsibilities can be understood through activity 
data collection and its analysis on continuous basis, and provide activity data to GHG 
inventory team at CCPIU, so that the GHG inventory can be compiled. The main source of 
activity data collection is the National Statistics Office (NSO) of Mongolia and the relevant 
institutions are shown above in the figure. Additional statistics from international sources 
were used such as International Energy Agency (IEA), Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) and World Bank (WB). Some assumptions were made for unavailable activity data 
in order to complete the time series. 

The national system for sustainable inventory preparation is utmost important for the 
continuous, robust and decentralized preparation of a national GHG inventory. The 
next table provides more detailed information about the current preparation process of 
national GHG inventory. The GHG inventory team consists of three specialists of CCPIU, of 
each responsible for energy and IPPU, AFOLU, and waste sectors.

2.2 Trends in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions 

2.2.1 Description and interpretation of emission trends for aggregated GHG emissions 

The main sources of GHG emissions have been divided into the following sectors: energy 
(CRF 1), industrial processes and product use (IPPU, CRF 2), agriculture (CRF 3), land use, 
land use change and forestry (LULUCF, CRF 4) and waste (CRF 5). 

Total GHG emissions in Mongolia in 2014 were 34,482.73 Gg CO2e (excluding LULUCF). 
This represented 57.09% increase from the 1990 level of 21,950.73 Gg CO2e and 5.49% 
increase from the 2013 level with 32,687.27 Gg CO2e. Net GHG emissions in 2014 were 
10,030.80 Gg CO2e (including LULUCF). This represented a 1,034.44% increase from the 
1990 level of -1,073.46 Gg CO2e and of 23.23% increase from the 2013 level with 8,139.60 
Gg CO2e (Figure 2-2 and Table 2-2).

Figure 2-2: Mongolia’s total and net GHG emissions and removals, 1990-2014 (Gg CO2e)

In general, emission and removal from each sector increased in 2014 comparing to the 
base year and differences are showed in Table 2-2 by percentage changes and absolute 
values of each GHG inventory sectors.

GHG emissions in 2014 from the energy sector were 17,267.79 Gg CO2e accounting for 
50.08% of total national emissions. The second highest sharing of the total emission were 
from the agriculture sector with 16,726.98 Gg CO2e accounting for 48.51%. Emissions 
from IPPU and waste sector contributed 328.10 Gg CO2e (0.95%) and 159.91 Gg CO2e 
(0.46%) respectively to the national total in 2014 (Figure 2-3). 

Figure 2-3: The composition of Mongolian GHG emissions by sectors in 2014

Table 2-3 shows that average annual growth rates (AAGR) of every 5 years within inventory 
period by sectors and by national totals. The average annual growth rates of energy and 
IPPU sector were decreasing 1990-1995 and 1996-2000 subsequently and then increased 
up to 7.05% and 9.03% between 2011 and 2014. The agriculture sector’s growth rate 
shows rise and decline between 1990 and 2014, the highest annual average growth 
rate percentage occurred from 2011 to 2014. On the Waste sector, the rapid increase of 
growth rate percentage observed from 1996 to 2014 continuously. In countrywide, from 
1990 to 2014, the average annual growth in total emissions was 2.17% per year.

Two main sources of the total emission were energy and agriculture sector for all years of 
the inventory. However, percentage share of emission sources were varied year by year 
depending on economic and climatic factors such as demand increase in energy sector 
and natural disaster occurrence in agriculture sector. Figure 2-4 shows that contribution 
of sectors to the Mongolia’s total emissions for the period 1990-2014.

3. MITIGATION ACTIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS 

Mongolia has submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) to 
UNFCCC on September 24, 2015. On its INDC, Mongolia set the target to mitigate GHG 
emission by 14% in economy-wide range excluding agriculture sector by 2030 compared 
to 2010 level. To assess overall mitigations actions to identify the future trends, the actions, 
policies and programs implemented or will be implemented through the national and 
sectorial policy framework and counter measures are considered. The assessment is based 
on the implementation of policies and programs which are implemented from 2007 to 
2015. The key national policy documents on GHG mitigations actions are Sustainable 
Development Vision 2030 (2016), State Policy on Food and Agriculture (2016), State Policy 
on Forest (2015), State Policy on Energy (2015), Green Development Policy (2014) and 
National Program on Waste Management Improvement (2014). The key policies and 
actions are outlined to assess the future projections and current status of GHG mitigation 
actions and their effects.

3.1.2 Joint crediting mechanism (JCM)

The Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) is a program in which Japan’s initiative in pursuit of 
the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC. On January 8, 2013, Government of Mongolia and 
Japan signed in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, a bilateral document “Low Carbon Development 
Partnership” which concerning the JCM. Both countries are established a joint committee 
to operate the JCM. This Japan-Mongolia partnership is the first partnership signed by 
Japan for this purpose. Under the partnership, joint study has been taken in energy 
supply-improve Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant to identify Business as Usual 
(BAU) and NAMA scenario in the energy supply sector. Total of 18 projects have been 
taken between 2013-2017 fiscal year with contribution of Ministry of Environment 
Japan’s subsidy and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Japan. Out of total projects, 
14 feasibility studies and demonstration and model projects are conducted. As of fiscal 
year 2017, three projects are selected as model project under the financing scheme for 
JCM model projects by the Ministry of Environment of Japan. 

Mongolia has four registered JCM projects in the energy sector. The four projects’ total 
volume of expected emission reduction is 13,465 tCO2 per year. In 2016, Mongolia issued 
its first CERs from registered projects under the standards MN_001 and MN_002 which 
are equivalent to 157 CERs in total (Table 3-2). Upon the discussion between each side, 
Mongolia received 32 CERs while Japan received 125 CERs.

CHAPTER 3

Mitigation Actions and Their Effects

The projected GHG emissions and removal by sources/sinks in BAU scenario is outlined 
in Figure 3-2. If the actions described on the national policies and programs (Figure 3-1) 
are implemented completely, GHG emissions can be reduced about 25% in 2025 and 
about 28% in 2030. Due to lack of data availability on certain sectorial GHG emissions, the 
projected emission reduction could be higher. 

Figure 3-1: Projected GHG emissions and removal by sources/sinks by sectors, BAU

In 2030, GHG emissions in BAU scenario using 2010 as the base year is projected that 
2.7 times of reduction in energy sector, 5.0 times of reduction in cement production, 2.4 
times of reduction in livestock sector, 1.5 times of reduction in agriculture, 1.9 times in of 
reduction waste sector, while removal of follow land decreased by 2.1 times and forest 
removal potential is expected to increase.

Mongolia’s Initial Biennial Update Report

CHAPTER 3

Mitigation Actions and Their Effects

In 2030, GHG emissions by gases in BAU scenario using 2010 as the base year is projected 
that 3.3 times increase of carbon dioxide (CO2), 2.3 times increase of methane (CH4), 2.6 
times increase of nitrous oxide (N2O).

3.2.1 Energy

The key policies toward to mitigate GHG emissions in the energy sector includes “Law on 
Energy” (approved on 2001, updated on 2015), “Law on renewable energy” (approved on 
2007, updated on 2015) and “Law on energy saving” (2015). Green Development Policy, 
State policy on energy and Sustainable Development Vision 2030 are also considered 
as the key policy documents. Mongolia put the goal to reduce the GHG emissions by 
2% from the current levels in 2020, by 7% in 2025 and by 14% by 2030 by promoting 
renewable energy sources and to introduce advanced technologies in liquefying and 
carbonating coal and shale. Increased energy efficiency and share of renewable energy 
are the two main approaches to policies and actions to mitigate GHG emissions. Table 
3-4 outlines the policies and measures on mitigation and its status of implementation.

CHAPTER 3

Mitigation Actions and Their Effects

A Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system (LEAP) model was used to estimate 
projections of GHG emissions between 2010 and 2030 in Mongolia. The assessments 
are made using social-economic data before 2010 to 2015. Population, number of 
households, GDP and their future changes are the key indicators to estimate energy 
intensity and to plan energy (Table 3-5).

CHAPTER 3

Mitigation Actions and Their Effects

The current capacity, production, efficiency coefficient of the renewable energy source 
is used as the baseline scenario for estimating the GHG emission of the energy sector. 
Figure 3-4 outlined the baseline scenario of energy sector. Energy sector GHG emissions 
are expected to increase by 17.4, 23.2, 29.9 and 37.7 mln t CO2e in 2015, 2020, 2025 and 
2030 respectively. 

Figure 3-3: GHG emissions in energy sector

By the energy demand of the sectors, heat and electricity production and industry 
sectors are dominant and continue to increase intensively until 2030. The share of the 
net emissions in the energy sector will be decreased although GHG emissions from 
other sectors will be increased (Figure 3-4). The rising demand for energy reflects to the 
production intensity thus GHG emissions will increase (Table 3-7).

Mitigation Actions and Their Effects

3.2.2 Industry

State Great Khural has approved “State Policy on Industry” in 2015. A key measure to 
mitigate GHG emission is to convert cement production from wet to dry processing. 
Cement production accounts for 70% of import even domestic cement production 
increased between 2007 and 2015. In 2015, net production of cement was 410.1thous 
tons equals to 10% of the installed capacity of the production. The cement factories that 
have the capacity to fully meet domestic demand have commissioned since 2016. Total 
installed capacity reached to four million tons but unable to work in full capacity due to 
poor sale and purchase in the market and import from China. 

Table 3-11 outlines the current status of implementation of policies and measures to 
mitigate GHG emissions in the industry sector. 

Table 3-11: Policies and measures to mitigate GHG emissions in industry sector

1. Adopt dry processing technology in cement production 

National Action Plana on Climate Change

Programme to support 
construction material 
production:

- Adopt dry processing 
technology in cement 
production

- Fully converted into dry 
processing technology, 
reduce consumption 
of fuel, electricity, water 
consumption and 
reduce price by 30 to 
40%. 

 - By 2015, an annual 
capacity of cement 
production will reach 
four million ton and fully 
meet domestic need. 

Fully adopt 
dry processing 
technology 
in cement 
production and 
reduce price by 
30% to 40%. 

Implementation: 

-“Cement and Lime” Co.ltd., in Khutul fully adopted dry 
processing technology in 2014 and amount of production 
dramatically increased. Reduced 8,400 t CO2 in 2014 and 
10,200 t CO2 in 2015 respectively. 

- In 2016, installed capacity in cement production reached 
four million ton. It include: “Cement and Lime” Co.ltd., in 
Khutul, “Moncement” of Monpoliment Co.ltd., “Munkhin 
bayan gal” Co.ltd., and “MAK Cement” Co.ltd., with an 
installed capacity to produce one million ton cement per 
year respectively. 

Expected outcome:

In 2020, cement production will reach 3.6 million ton and 
GHG emission reduction is 664,000 t CO2e by technology 
improvement and 91,000 tCO2e by energy saving. In 2030, 
cement production will reach 6.2 million ton and GHG 
emission reduction is 1,147,400 t CO2e by technology 
improvement and 157,000 t CO2e by energy saving.

share of processed 
produce in leather, 
wool and cashmere up 
to 70% in the total raw 
material produced

In 2030, increase 
the share of 
processed 
produce in

leather, wool and 
cashmere up to 
80% in the total 
raw material 
produced

Mongolia Sustainable Development 
Vision 2030 is approved by State Great 
Khural by 2016 and thus no information 
is available on its implementation. 

 

Expected outcome:

Transfer clean and advanced 
technology, decrease energy intensity 
per unit of GDP, increase domestic 
revenue. Reduce the unemployment 
rate.





The future demand projection is based on the estimation of demand that will reach to 
3.5-4.4 mln tons by 2020 in line with implementation of infrastructure policy and “Taliin 
Zam” mega project. 

To select emission factor used these calculation (energy consumption 0.05/ton + de- 
carbonization 0.4985/ton + 0.335/ton) [Source: technology/energy-saving-cement] for 
one ton of cement production. The calculations suggest that this will reduce energy 
consumption by 50% in the first scenario, by 30% in the second scenario and reduce fuel 
consumption two times by adopting dry processing technology.

Mitigation Actions and Their Effects

Figure 3-8: CO2 emission projection from cement production

In early 2016, Mongolia was able to supply its gross domestic product by cement 
produced by dry technology. “Cement and Lime” Co.ltd, in Khutul adopted dry processing 
technology in 2014 with the capacity to produce one million ton cement in dry technology 
and stopped production of the two plants with wet technology. It made possible to fully 
meet the domestic needs by the end of 2016 by operationalizing four factors in dry 
processing. This will have an effect on the increase of labor force, decrease the price of 
cement and energy consumption of cement production by 30% and fuel consumption 
by two times. By shifting to dry processing technology, GHG emission reduction will be 
664,000 t CO2e in 2020 and 1,147,400 t CO2e in 2030 respectively. 

3.2.3 Livestock 

The State Great Khural has approved “Mongolian Livestock” National Program in 2010 and 
the measures to be implemented through 2010-2021 are identified. 

The State Great Khural has approved “State Policy on Food and Agriculture” in 2015. The 
goal of the policy in livestock sector is to promote intensified livestock production in 
crop cultivated regions, suburban and settled areas while preserving traditional animal 
husbandry patterns, improve livestock sector economic growth, productivity and 
competitiveness, and ensure openness of domestic and foreign trade. 

The State policies and measures to mitigate GHG emissions in livestock sector are outlined 
in Table 3-12 below.

CHAPTER 3

Mitigation Actions and Their Effects

For forecasting GHG emission of the livestock sector, the historic data on livestock number 
from NSO, indicators of “Mongolian Livestock” National Program and “State Policy on Food 
and Agriculture”, the actual number of livestock before the start of “Mongolian Livestock 
Program” in 2010 and until 2015 were used. Three different estimations of change of 
livestock number (Figure 3-9 - 11) and methane emission of internal fermentation (Figure 
3-12, 13) were estimated using IPCC Guidelines 2006 Tier 1 emission factors5. 

The results of projection suggested that if the “Mongolian Livestock Program” is fully 
implemented number of livestock will be 36,475.6 thous thus GHG emission from the 
livestock sector will be decreased by 15% or 1,700 Gg CO2e in 2020 and 21% or 3,070 Gg 
CO2e in 2030 from BAU scenario respectively. 

By implementing these policies and programs, a certain increase of production can be 
expected by 2021 from the 2008 level: meat supply by 1.4 times, meat export by 1.5 times, 
and cow milk per year 1.8 times (SGKh, 2010). Furthermore, herders’ revenue is estimated 
to increase by 80% in 2020 and carrying capacity of the pasture could be improved.

Sustainable Development Vision 2030 as introduced new technologies. 

Potential to reduce GHG emissions is estimated based on the difference between these 
two projections.

Mitigation Actions and Their Effects

By rejecting traditional technology and introducing planned zero and reduced tillage 
technology, and the re-use of abandoned area, GHG emission will be reduced by 323 Gg 
in 2020, 400 Gg in 2025 and 485 Gg in 2030. 

3.2.5 Forest

The key policy document on forest management is “State Policy on Forest” 2015 and 
objectives is focused to mitigate deforestation and degradation of the forest, reclamation 
of the forest, and to promote robust management of the forest. State policies and 
measures to mitigate GHG emissions in the forest sector are outlined in Table 3-14 below.

CHAPTER 3

Mitigation Actions and Their Effects

To estimate forest biomass change using COMAP model, data from NSO and objectives 
of key policy and programs were considered. 

Figure 3-19: Change in biomass of forest, COMAP model

As indicated in the estimation, carbon sink potential will increase by 7% in 2020 and 17% 
in 2030 in BAU scenario. 

3.2.6 Waste 

The GHG emission from the waste sector is classified as solid waste and waste water from 
industry and municipality. Population growth, urbanization and industrialization lead to 
the increase of waste and change of components of the waste that average volume of 
waste is increased by 500 thous tons per year in Mongolia. The State Greate Khural stated 
that thevolume of the waste has tripled in the fouryear period, 820 thous tons in 2009 and 
2.4 mln tons in 2013 (SGKh 2014). Based on the data of national GHG inventory, methane 
emission from solid waste disposal center accounts for more than 45% of waste sector. 

State policies and measures to mitigate GHG emissions in the waste sector are outlined 
in Table 3-15 below.

The projection of GHG emission of solid waste (Figure 3-20) is estimated using data of 
total population and equation of multiple variables regression (regression coefficient 
0.97). Future projections of GHG emission until 2030 is estimated using three different 
scenarios of population growth, main export products and value of GDP reflected to 
price stated by NSO.

CHAPTER 3

Mitigation Actions and Their Effects

Figure 3-21 shows the future GHG emission reduction potential of solid waste in BAU 
scenario taking into account the outcome of actions to recycle and reuse reflected in 
national policies and programs. Based on the estimation, Mongolia is able to fully recycle 
and reuse solid waste by 2027. 

Figure 3-21: GHG emission reduction from solid waste

 

3.3 Domestic MRV mechanism 

A critical requirement for mitigation actions is that actions be implemented in a 
measurable, reportable and verifiable (MRV) manner. Recognizing the role of mitigation 
actions to reducing GHG emissions while simultaneously promoting country’s sustainable 
development objectives, Mongolia will advocate for a broader approach to MRV that 
establishes a robust mechanism in line with its commitment under the UNFCCC .The 
initial experience with different elements of the MRV for GHG emissions has already been 
gained through the implementation of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects 
under the Kyoto Protocol. Moreover, significant effort has also been done under the 
preparation of the national GHG inventories, a crucial element of the overall MRV system. 

Mongolia has approved through its Agency of Standard and Metrology (MASM) ISO14064 
and ISO 14065 standards as a national standars for MRV between 2012 and 2013. National 
renewable energy center (NREC) had become the first nationally accredited entity for 
MRV in 2014. 

Further, the MRV methods for project based activities is expected to evolve and be 
simplified, allowing the necessary information for emission reductions from individual 
activities to be collected from the already existing information in the GHG inventory and 
statistical data.

Under the JCM bilateral framework, third party entity (TPE) assesses the information and 
applies the means of validation and currently CERs is 107 tons of CO2.

4. CONSTRAINTS AND GAPS, AND RELATED FINANCIAL, 
TECHNICAL AND CAPACITY NEEDS

Mongolia, as many other developing countries, has specific barriers for the implementation 
of adaptation and mitigation measures such as financial and technical resources, human 
and institutional capacity, and public support. The biggest problems facing the electricity 
and heat production sectors in reducing GHG emissions are the use of obsolete techniques 
and technologies, low coal quality, and insufficient funds. The most widely recognized 
constraints are considered below:

In the second national communication, Mongolia has reported that in the near future, 
while coal will remain the basis of energy production, the following technologies need to 
be introduced and implemented: 

• Clean coal technology and clean fuel production

• Establishing a power plant with integrated coal gasification combined cycle

• Setting up a Carbon capture and storage (CCS) plant.

The above measures are subject to very high upfront investment and recurring operating 
costs. Particularly the costs of technologies and infrastructures have been a major 
constraint to successful implementation.

The implementation of mitigation measures requires a high level of technical capacity and 
effective coordination across different sectorial agencies, which are currently a challenge 
for Mongolia. Most of the technologies applied in Mongolia’s energy sector are still old 
and have low efficiency and high energy losses. The heat content of the feedstock coal 
is low and variable, which leads to combustion problems and poor plant performance. 
A lack of appropriate technologies and know-how is the most urgent technical problem. 

Other key financial, technical and capacity barriers include a lack of support by financial 
institutions for renewable energy investments (particularly hydro-power plants); lacks of 
domestic technological and technical resources for clean fuel production; and CCS plant.

As mentioned before, reporting of National Communications including GHG inventory 
and BUR is financed by GEF enabling activities through UNEP. In other words, there was 
no substantial government financing (except in kind contribution) for these reporting 
requirements because of the economic difficulties in Mongolia, as the country is 
undergoing a transition period, the Government fails to resolve financing issues. 

Further financial, technical and capacity-building needs of Mongolia for preparing and 
implementing mitigation projects are listed in NAMA is given in Table 4-1.

4.1 Information on the Support Received 

Financial support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) towards the preparation of 
BUR was received in December 2015, while as per UNFCCC decision 2/CP.17 as reported 
in document number UNFCCC/CP/2011/9/Add.1 clause 44, it should have been received 
as early as possible in 2012.

During 2011-2013, MET implemented a project on Strengthening Carbon Financing 
for Regional Grassland Management in NE Asia/2011-2013 with a support of the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB). ADB supported regional cooperation among countries of 
Northeast Asia to combat dust and sandstorms resulting from desertification. ADB has 
strengthened the capacity of the government of Mongolia in accessing carbon financing 
to sustainably manage grassland. The project recognizes that healthy ecosystems are 
more productive, more resilient, and provides valuable ecosystem services, such as 
carbon sequestration (ADB, 2013).



Mongolia’s Initial Biennial Update Report

CHAPTER 4

Constraints and Gaps, and Related Financial, Technical and Capacity Needs

Mongolia is seeking alternatives to replace fossil fuels such as coal that power its industry 
and mines. The Government has set a target to get 20% to 25% of its energy from 
renewables by 2020, whereas the reliance on energy from renewable sources is 2%. Coal 
contribution is about 80% of the nation’s energy production.

The Salkhit wind farm with capacity 50 MW is a flagship project for Mongolia’s renewable 
energy sector and the energy sector as a whole. The project has introduced a new and 
advanced technology and know-how to the industry. The wind farm will offset 180 
thousand tons of CO2 emissions, save 1.6 million tons of fresh water, and reduce coal 
usage by 122 thousand tons annually.

Low emission and energy efficient approaches in Mongolia’s construction and housing 
sector were implemented during 2009-2013. The objective of Building energy efficiency 
project (BEEP) was to reduce the annual growth rate of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
from building sectors in Mongolia, by improving the energy utilization efficiency in new 
construction in the residential and commercial buildings.

In 2012, the Government of Mongolia announced that green development would be the 
new economic development strategy for the country. To facilitate this, the Government 
established the Ministry of Environment and Green Development (MEGD). The Global 
Green Growth Institute (GGGI) is assisting Mongolia in developing and implementing a 
national green growth plan within the transport and energy sectors. The Strategies for 
Development of Green Energy Systems in Mongolia project was completed in early 2014 
by the GGGI in collaboration with the Mongolian government, Stockholm Environment 
Institute, and the United States (GGGI, 2014).

A new initiative to develop and incentivize ecological, low emission and energy efficient 
approaches in Mongolia’s construction and housing sector is being launched in 2016. 
The “Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions in the construction sector in Mongolia” 
(NAMA) Project will run until 2020. It aims to limit the need for coal powered heating and 
reduce the country’s winter air pollution.

The objective of the project is to facilitate market transformation for energy efficiency in the 
construction sector through the development and implementation of NAMA in Mongolia. 
This objective will be achieved by removing barriers to increased adoption of energy 
efficient technology in construction sector through three components; i) establishment 
of baseline energy consumption and GHG emission in the construction sectors ii) 
development and implementation of NAMA in the construction sector iii) measuring, 
reporting and verification (MRV) systems for NAMA. This project will be implemented 
over a 40 months period and is expected to achieve GHG emission reductions through 
the displacement of electricity heat generation from coal power plants and CHPs. Direct 
GHG emission reduction over the lifetime of the project is estimated to be 64,219 t CO2e. 
The estimated range of potential indirect emission reduction is 57,435 to 438,926 t CO2e 
that is cumulative for a 10-year period after the end of the project.

MET has also implemented project on Improving Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings 
in Khovd and Zavkhan aimags in 2014-2016 which is supported by the German Federal 
Enterprise for International Cooperation (GIZ). The energy savings in the renovated 
buildings were estimated to be up to 50%. This study proved that large cross cutting

benefits are achievable and result in improved health, energy savings, and reduce air 
pollution and CO2 emissions (GIZ, 2016). 

The Multipurpose National Forest Inventory (MPNFI) implemented in 2014-2016 is the 
first exercise of its kind in Mongolia. The inventory was supported by technical assistance 
from international expertise mobilized through a collaboration project between the MET 
and the GIZ and was implemented under the responsibility of the Forest Research and 
Development Center (FRDC), which ensures the long-term sustainability of the MPNFI.

Japan initiated the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) as a tool to complement CDM 
under the UNFCCC, with the aim of facilitating widespread applications of low carbon 
technologies, and ultimately reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Implementation in 
Mongolia has been focused on high-tech low carbon technologies that can be applied 
by the private sector in 13 identified sectors. Japan will cover 50% of the project costs and 
in return will take the carbon reduction credits generated from the subsidized projects 
until 2020. Three methodologies are approved such as Installation of energy-saving 
transmission lines in the Mongolian Grid, Replacement and Installation of High Efficiency 
Heat Only Boiler (HOB) for Hot Water Supply Systems and Installation of Solar PV System.

UN-REDD

Mongolia is participating in the UN-REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and 
forest Degradation). A National REDD+ Roadmap Taskforce in Mongolia was established 
in September 2011 and consists of 20 members representing different government, 
private sectors and civil society. 

The MET coordinates UN-REDD+ activities and thus is responsible for mitigation in the 
forestry sector. The UN-REDD National Programme for Mongolia was launched in February 
2016 with the overall objective: “To support the Government of Mongolia in designing 
and implementing its National REDD+ Strategy and in meeting the requirements under 
the UNFCCC Warsaw Framework to receive REDD+ results-based payments”. 

The UN-REDD Programme, an initiative jointly implemented by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nation, the United Nations Development Programme and 
the United Nations Environment Programme, is providing support to the Government of 
Mongolia, to get ready for REDD+. It will work together with the Ministry of Environment 
and Tourism and other stakeholders over the next three years to assist Mongolia in 
meeting all the requirements to ultimately be eligible for results-based payments. 
Mongolia REDD+ national programme has four main outcomes. 

Under Outcome One of the Roadmap, the National Programme will support the 
establishment of Mongolia’s REDD+Readiness management structure to oversee 
the delivery of the key results described in the Roadmap and to prepare its National 
REDD+Strategy.

Under Outcome Two of the Roadmap, the National Programme will support the preparation 
of Mongolia’s National REDD+ Strategy through which key drivers of deforestation and 
forest degradation in Mongolia will be analyzed through detailed studies, and specific 
policies and measures to address those key identified drivers.

Under Outcome Three of the Roadmap, the National Programme will support the 
establishment of national forest Reference Emission Level and/or forest Reference Level 
(REL/RL), with sub-national forest RELs/RLs as potential interim measures.

Under Outcome Four of the Roadmap, the National Programme will support the 
development of a national forest monitoring system, comprising a monitoring function 
and a Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) function

Reduction of air pollution

In addition to long-term benefits of greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions in the form of 
avoided health and ecosystem damage, there are important near-term benefits resulting 
reduction of air pollution. 

The Government of Mongolia has been taking a series of measures to reduce air pollution 
in the urban area, especially in Ulaanbaatar, such as low-smoke stoves, promoting electric 
cars setting “0” customs tax, and collecting air pollution fees from motor vehicles. For

implementation of air pollution reduction measures, the government is cooperating with 
international organization such as Millennium Challenge Account – Mongolia.

The Energy and Environment Project or as known Clean Air Project in Mongolian is 
implemented by the Millennium Challenge Account – Mongolia (MCA-Mongolia) and 
funded by the U.S. Government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The energy 
efficient stoves subsidized by the project use 20% to 30% less fuel, and emit 70% to 90% 
less pollution than traditional stoves. During the course of the project, nearly 100,000 
improved stoves, 20,000 Ger insulation kits, 4500 vestibules, and 100 energy efficient 
homes were subsidized.

CHAPTER 1

Introduction

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background information on greenhouse gas inventories 

Mongolia has signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) on 12th June of 1992 and ratified on 30th September of 1993. With respect 
to the Kyoto Protocol (KP) of the UNFCCC Mongolia has ratified on 15th December of 
1999. Mongolia is a developing country and as a non-Annex I Party, are not obligated 
to reduce its GHG emissions under the regulations of KP, but under the Paris Agreement 
(PA), Mongolia has set its targets to reduce GHG emissions compared to business as usual 
(BAU) scenario until 2030. 

Mongolia’s National Inventory Report (NIR) has been prepared as a part of its initial 
Biennial Update Report (iBUR). The NIR contains updated accounts of net greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions estimate for the period of 1990-2014. 

The GHG inventory for the NIR has been compiled using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
for National Greenhouse Gas inventories (IPCC 2006). But the NIR has been prepared 
according to UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of biennial update reporting for 
Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 40 and 
annex III of decision 2/CP.17). 

Mongolia has done its GHG inventories four times, namely the first one in 1996 for the base 
year 1990 under the U.S. Country Studies Program (USCSP)1. This inventory was updated 
within the Asia Least-Cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy (ALGAS2, a regional 
project implemented by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)). As part of enabling activities 
of preparation of the Mongolia’s initial National Communication (GEF/UNEP), the GHG 
inventories were updated to 1998 for the third time. In accordance with the preparation 
of Second National Communication (SNC) in 2010, the national GHG inventories have 
been compiled for the period 1990-2006. Generally the Tier 1 method of the Revised 1996 
IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (revised IPCC 1996) was used for all sectors 
except some subcategories of energy and agriculture (enteric fermentation). The country 
specific emission factors (EFs) were used for coal and livestock. 

In scope of the preparation of initial BUR (iBUR) and Third National Communication (TNC), 
the national GHG inventories have been compiled using the IPCC 2006 and its Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 methods (country specific EFs for coal types). Although non-Annex I Parties are not 
obligated to use IPCC 2006, Mongolia decided to change the GHG inventories estimation 
method to the IPCC 2006.

Previous GHG inventory results have been reported as part of the National Communications 
(NCs). For the BUR Mongolia has prepared the NIR to present GHG inventory results. 

1 The aim of the USCSP (no longer in existence) was to assist developing countries and countries with economies 
in transition in meeting their obligations under the UNFCCC.

(http://unfccc.int/files/adaptation/methodologies_for/vulnerability_and_adaptation/application/pdf/us_
country_studies_program__uscsp_.pdf)

2 The aim of the ALGAS (executed by the ADB, 1995-1998) was to develop national, regional capacities for the 
preparation of GHG inventories, help to identify GHG abatement options, and prepare a portfolio of abatement 
projects for each country. 

(https://www.adb.org/publications/series/asia-least-cost-greenhouse-gas-abatement-strategy-algas) 



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 1

Introduction

The preparation of NIR is not only meant to serve the purpose of meeting international 
report obligations, but it provides the basis for setting up a national emissions reduction 
targets and MRV system for tracking them in national development policies, sustainable 
institutional arrangement, GHG inventory system and capacity building. 

Greenhouse gases covered

The inventory covers sources of GHG emissions which results from anthropogenic activities 
for direct GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), indirect 
GHGs such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and Hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs) and their removals by sinks. Net emissions have been presented in carbon dioxide 
equivalents (CO2e) using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs)3 from the 1995 
IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). 

Sectors covered 

The GHG inventory has been conducted for key economic sectors that support Mongolia’s 
economic development. The emissions/removals have been estimated from four sectors 
which are defined by the IPCC 2006. The sectors are: (1) Energy, (2) Industrial processes 
and product use, (3) Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) and (4) Waste. 

1.2 General description of the institutional arrangement for GHG inventory 
preparation 

1.2.1 Overview of institutional arrangement for compiling GHG inventory 

The Article 24 of the Law on Air (1995; 2012) states that “the designated government 
authority shall estimate the emissions and removals of GHGs of Mongolia following the 
methodologies approved by the Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC”. 

The Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) of Mongolia is the key ministry to 
develop, update and implement climate related policies. Thus, the MET and its Climate 
Change and International Cooperation Department (CCICD) are the national entities 
with overall responsibility for organizing and coordinating the compilation of National 
Communications, Biennial updated reports, GHG inventory and submitting them to the 
UNFCCC Secretariat through the National focal point for the UNFCCC. 

In order to facilitate smooth implementation of commitments under UNFCCC, the MET 
established climate change project implementing unit (CCPIU) at the Environment and 
Climate Fund (ECF) under the ministry. The CCPIU is also supervised by National focal 
point for the UNFCCC.

The inventory team of CCPIU, which consists of three sectorial experts, with the 
cooperation of relevant ministries, agencies and organizations, prepares national GHG 
inventory and compiles supplementary information. 

3 The source of GWPs used is the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). The GWPs of direct GHGs are: 1=CO2, 
21=CH4, 310=N2O, HFC-134a=1300, HFC-152a=140, HFC-143a=3800. GWPs for indirect GHGs are not available. 
However they were reported but are not included in the inventory total.

Figure 1-1 shows the overall institutional arrangement for Mongolia’s inventory preparation. 
More detailed information on the role and responsibility of relevant ministries, agencies 
and organizations in the inventory preparation process is described in the Table 1-1. 

Figure 1-1: Institutional arrangement for the GHG inventory compilation of Mongolia

1.2.2 Overview of inventory preparation and management 

Currently, the preparation of national GHG inventory is centralized and is being compiled 
at CCPIU of ECF under the ministry. The main source of activity data is the National 
statistics office (NSO) of Mongolia and relevant institutions are shown above in figure1-1. 
Additional statistics from international sources were used such as the International Energy 
Agency (IEA), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Bank (WB). Some 
assumptions were made for unavailable activity data in order to complete the time series. 

Table 1-1 provides more detailed information about the current preparation process of 
national GHG inventory. The GHG inventory team consists of three specialists of CCPIU, of 
each responsible for energy and IPPU, AFOLU, and waste sectors.

1.3 Brief general description of methodologies and data sources

Emissions of GHGs from various sources and sink categories have been estimated using 
methodologies that are consistent with the IPCC 2006 even though non-Annex I Parties 
are not obliged to do so. The reason for using the IPCC 2006 is that, the guidelines include 
updated methods and improved default values. 

GHG emissions estimates have been made in accordance with the IPCC 2006 methods. In 
general Tier 1 IPCC method was applied. However there were selected categories such as 
fuel combustion and fugitive emissions from solid fuels, LULUCF for which Tier 2 method 
was used.

CHAPTER 1

Introduction

1.3.1 Methods of estimation 

The methodology for Mongolia’s GHG inventory has seen some improvements towards 
a combination of Tier 1 and Tier 2 estimation methods that causes shift from the revised 
IPCC 1996 to the IPCC 2006 and uncertainty assessment. An overview of the methods 
and EFs applied for the calculations of the emissions is presented in Table 1-2.

1.3.2 Data sources 

Mongolia’s GHG inventory has been prepared using data from a combination of sources 
from national and international institutions. The main source of activity data are official 
statistics of Mongolia. According to recommendation of IPCC 2006, it is preferred to use 
data from national statistics. In cases where the required data was not available, the data 
from international sources such as IEA, FAO, WB and certain assumptions were used. 

MET signed the Memorandum of understanding (MOU) with NSO, Ministry of Energy 
(MOE), Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MCUD), Ministry of Food, 
Agriculture and Light Industry (MOFALI), Ministry of Road and Transport Development 
(MRTD), Ministry of Mining and Heavy Industry (MMHI) and Municipality of Ulaanbaatar 
City. The sectorial experts from CCPIU collect data and prepare the estimates for the 
national GHG inventory. The data sources for each sector are described in Table 1-3.

1.4 Brief description of key categories

Key categories are the categories of emissions/removals, which have a significant 
influence on the total inventory in terms of the absolute levels of emissions (1990 or 
2014), the trend of emissions (change between 1990 and 2014). There are two alternative 
methods for identifying key categories Tier 1 and Tier 2. In this report Tier 1 method has 
been used. The results are presented in Table 1-5 and 1-6. Those key categories have been 
chosen, whose cumulative contribution is less than 95%. The identification includes all 
reported greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs and IPCC source categories.

CHAPTER 1

Introduction

1.5 Information on the QA/QC plan including verification 

In accordance with IPCC 2006, volume 1, chapter 6 the quality control (QC) has been 
done within the inventory team. In 2013, as part of efforts to comply with the quality 
objectives of IPCC 2006 for inventory quality, transparency, and credibility, Mongolia has 
developed a quality assurance and quality control plan (QA/QC plan) which is designed 
to check document and improve the quality of the inventory over time. 

QA/QC activities on the inventory are undertaken within the framework of this QA/QC 
plan. The overall aim of QA/QC plan is to maintain and improve the quality in all stages of 
the inventory work. The QA/QC procedures represent the main instrument for continuous 
improvement in subsequent inventory cycles. The QA/QC plan guides the process of 
ensuring inventory quality by describing data and methodology checks, developing 
processes governing peer review and public comments, and developing guidance on 
conducting an analysis of the uncertainty surrounding the emission estimates. The QA/
QC procedures also include feedback loops and provide for corrective actions that are 
designed to improve the inventory estimates over time. 

Sector specific QA/QC plan is based on the general QA/QC rules and activities in specific 
categories. The sector specific QC activities were performed during the GHG emissions 
calculation (the GHG emissions calculation has been done by the 2006 IPCC Inventory 
Software) such as checking several data sources and data inputs into the software, 
including the QC for the EFs and other parameters as well. 

The main source of activity data of GHG emissions estimation is the National statistics 
office of Mongolia (NSO). Generally the NSO collects and consolidates data from 
organizations/institutions and producers by questionnaires at national level. For the QC/
QA, done cross checks of activity data provided by NSO and institutions provide data to 
NSO. Special data sheets were prepared to collect data from relevant government and 
private organizations/institutions in order to compare and ensure with the data from 
NSO. 

In some cases, NSO data differ from the data directly provided by questioned organizations/
institutions. The IPCC 2006 recommends that if there is availability of several sources of 
the activity data, it is a good practice to follow the data from national statistics. Thus NSO 
data was used for the inventory. Focus group meetings were organized to be agreed on 
assumptions made from calculations. Expert peer reviews are commissioned to provide 
in-depth analysis of CS EFs in energy and waste sectors. Internal reviews of the NIR, GHG 
inventory, CRF tables are made prior to approval. 

1.6 General uncertainty evaluation

The uncertainty estimate of the 2014 inventory has been done according to the Tier 1 
method presented by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
(IPCC 2006). Tier 1 method combines the uncertainty in activity rates and EFs, for each 
source category and GHG, and then aggregates these uncertainties for all sources of 
categories and GHGs to obtain the total uncertainty for the inventory. 



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 1

Introduction

In many cases, uncertainty values have been assigned based on default uncertainty 
estimates according to IPCC guidelines or expert judgement due to lack of the information. 
The uncertainty analysis was done for the sectors: energy, IPPU, AFOLU and waste sectors. 
The base year for assessment of uncertainty in trend is 1990 and the assessment has been 
done until 2014. The results of the uncertainty analysis for all sectors have been presented 
in Annex III. 

1.7 General assessment of the completeness

2.1 Description and interpretation of emission trends for aggregated GHG 
emissions 

The main sources of GHG emissions have been divided into the following sectors: Energy 
(CRF 1), Industrial processes and Product Use (IPPU, CRF 2), Agriculture (CRF 3), Land use, 
Land use change and Forestry (LULUCF, CRF 4) and Waste (CRF 5). 

Total GHG emissions in Mongolia in 2014 were 34,482.73 Gg CO2e (excluding LULUCF). 
This represents a 57.09% increase from the 1990 level of 21,950.73 Gg CO2e and 5.49% 
increase from the 2013 level with 32,687.27 Gg CO2e. Net GHG emissions in 2014 were 
10,030.80 Gg CO2e (including LULUCF). This represented a 1,034.44% increase from the 
1990 level of -1,073.46 Gg CO2e and 23.23% increase from the 2013 level with 8,139.60 Gg 
CO2e (Figure 2-1 and Table 2-1).

Figure 2-1: Mongolia’s total and net GHG emissions and removals, 1990-2014 (Gg CO2e)

In general, emissions and removals from each sector are increased in 2014 compared 
to the base year and the differences are shown in Table 2-1 by percentage and absolute 
values of each GHG inventory sectors.

GHG emissions in 2014 from the energy sector were 17,267.79 Gg CO2e accounting for 
50.08% of total national emissions. The agriculture sector with 16,726.98 Gg CO2e accounts 
for 48.51% of the national total. Emissions from IPPU and Waste sector contributed 328.1 
Gg CO2e (0.95%) and 159.91 Gg CO2e (0.46%) respectively to the national total in 2014 
(Figure 2-2). 

Figure 2-2: The composition of Mongolian GHG emissions by sectors in 2014

Table 2-2 shows that average annual growth rates (AAGR) of every 5 years within 
inventory period by sectors and by national totals. The average annual growth rates of 
Energy and IPPU sector were decreasing 1990-1995 and 1996-2000 subsequently, and 
then growth rate increased gradually in energy sector, while in IPPU sector it is increased 
rapidly in 2001-2005.. The agriculture sector’s growth rate mainly depends on livestock 
populations. Livestock population were dropped rapidly during 2000-2002 and 2009-
2010 due to harsh winter. In the waste sector, GHG growth rate is gradually increasing 
from 1996 to 2014 due to an increase in urban population. At the national level, the GHG 
emissions annual growth was 2.17% per year from 1990 to 2014.

CHAPTER 2

Trends in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions

The energy and agriculture sectors are the major sources for emissions for the entire time 
series. However, percentage to national total varied depending on economic and climatic 
factors such as demand increase in energy sector and natural disaster occurrences in the 
agriculture sector. Figure 2-3 shows that contribution of sectors to the Mongolia’s total 
emissions for the period 1990-2014.

for the period 1990-2014

2.2 Description and interpretation of emission trends sectors/categories

2.2.1 Energy 

The energy sector is the most 
significant source of the GHG 
emissions with 50.08% share 
of the national total emissions 
in 2014. The GHG emissions 
fluctuate in the latest years 
mainly due to economic trend, 
the energy supply structure 
and climate conditions. Total 
emissions in the energy sector in 2014 increased by 55.69% compared to the base 
year 1990. A large part of emissions in the energy sector comes from energy industries 
(electricity generation, electricity and heat production in CHPs) source category (54.87%). 
The emissions from energy industries increased by 3.81% compared to 2013. One of the 
factors influencing the GHG emissions from energy industries source category is the 
increasing energy demand. To reduce the GHG emissions from this source of category, 
the energy efficiency of electricity and heat production should be improved (see Figure 
2-4).

2.2.2 Agriculture 

In 2014, the agriculture sector accounted for 48.51% (16.726.97 Gg CO2e) of total national 
direct GHG emissions (without LULUCF), being the second major source of GHG emissions

after the energy sector in 
the country. Total emissions 
in agriculture sector in 2014 
increased by 58.02% compared 
to the base year 1990; in 
particular, due to an increasing 
number of domestic livestock 
which increased from 25.8 
million in 1990 to 51.9 million in 
2014 (see Figure 2-5). Emission 
reduction between 1999-2002 
and 2009-2010 caused by livestock loss during natural disaster.

2.2.3 Industrial Processes and 
Product Use (IPPU)

The Industrial Processes and 
Product Use (IPPU) sector 
contributes to 0.95% of the 
total GHG emissions in 2014. 
The total GHG emissions of 
IPPU sector in 2014 increased 
by 50.03% compared to the 
base year 1990. The emission 
fluctuations in IPPU sectors 
are linked with the economic 
situation of the country. The GHG emissions increased in 2014 by 37.72% compared to 
2013. The main contributor to the total emissions from IPPU sector is the mineral industry 
(cement and lime production) and it represents 68.86% of the total emissions. Cement 
and lime are important ingredients for building materials for production. The building 
material industry is growing in parallel with the population as well as the economy (see 
Figure 2-6).

2.2.4 Waste

The waste sector is an 
insignificant source of GHG 
emissions and contributes 
to only 0.46% of the national 
total. However, GHG emissions 
have increased continuously 
year after year in relation to the 
population growth especially in 
urban areas. Total aggregated 
emissions from the Waste

sectors have increased by 104.29 Gg CO2e (187.49%) from the 1990 level of 55.62 Gg 
CO2e. The total CO2 equivalent emissions from waste sector in 2014 increased by 7.93% 
compared to 2013 (Figure 2-7). 

2.2.5 Land use, land use 
change and forestry

LULUCF is a net sink in Mongolia 
accounted approximately for 
50% of net removal of the 
country’s direct GHG emission. 
Total removals were -24,451.93 
GgCO2e in 2014 and -23,024.18 
GgCO2e in the base year. This 
increase (6.2%) in 2014 is due to 
forest area expansion in recent 
years. According to the country’s land report, forest area has increased from 15,660.48 
thousand ha in 1990 to 16,864.77 thousand ha in 2014. Availability of data for LULUCF 
inventory is still lacking. It should be noted that only forest land remaining forest land 
category is reported under Land category for this submission (Figure 2-8). 

2.3 Description and interpretation of emission trends by gases

The most important GHG in Mongolia is carbon dioxide (CO2) (without LULUCF) 
accounting for 46.41% of the national total in 2014. The CO2 emissions primarily result from 
fuel combustion activities. Methane (CH4), which mainly arises from enteric fermentation 
of livestock and solid waste disposals contribute for 32.89% to the national total GHG 
emissions, and nitrous oxide (N2O) from agricultural soils contributes for 20.42% to the 
national total, and HFCs from refrigeration, air conditioning, fire protection and foam 
blowing equipment usage contributes to the remaining 0.28% in 2014. The trend of CO2, 
CH4 and N2O emissions are presented in figure 2-9. More information about Table 2-4 can 
be found from Chapters 2.3.1-2.3.4. 

The data on HFCs which are mostly emitted from the use of these gases in refrigeration 
and air conditioning equipment were available from 2012. The consumption data of 
HFCs were taken from the “Report for HFCs inventory and identification of opportunities 
for introduction of low GWP alternatives in Mongolia”. More details about HFCs can be 
found below in Chapter 3.2 Industrial processes and product use.

2.3.1 Carbon dioxide (CO2)

The CO2 emissions from all sectors (excl. LULUCF) increased by 46.46% from 1990 to 2014. 
The emissions from all (excl. LULUCF) increased from 10,927.61 in 1990 to 16,004.13 Gg 
CO2e in 2014 mainly due to higher emissions from energy sectors. 

The main source of CO2 emissions in Mongolia is fossil fuel combustion. Within the fuel 
combustion category, the energy industries is the most important sub-source with the 
growth of 81.92% from 5,178.13 Gg in 1990 to 9,420.14 Gg in 2014. The second contributor 
to CO2 emissions is the manufacturing industries and construction source category with 
a decline of 8.65% from 2,519.05 Gg in 1990 to 2,301.20 Gg in 2014.

2.3.2 Methane (CH4)

CH4 emissions increased from 6,872.62 to 11,341.60 Gg CO2e with a growth of 65.03% 
from 1990 to 2014. The main sources for CH4 emission in Mongolia are the enteric 
fermentation in agriculture sector, the fugitive emissions from coal mining and handling, 
and solid waste disposal on land (landfills).

Trends in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions

2.3.3 Nitrous oxide (N2O)

N2O emissions increased from 4,150.49 to 7,040.58 Gg CO2e for the period 1990-2014, 
which is 69.63% increase over the years. The main sources are: direct N2O emissions 
from managed soils; indirect N2O emissions from managed soils; energy industries; 
manufacturing industries and construction; transport and residential sectors, and 
domestic wastewater treatment and discharge.

 

2.3.4 Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)

The activity data for the estimation of HFCs emissions were available only from 2012 to 
2014. Therefore, the emissions have been estimated only for last few years. Since the HFC’s 
emissions are directly related to the consumption of applications which include fluorinated 
substitutes, emissions are increasing with the growing consumption of applications. For 
the emissions estimation for HFCs Tier 1 method of IPCC 2006 was used which used 
the default emission factors. The Tier 1 method then back-calculates the development of 
banks of a refrigerant from the current reporting year to the year of its introduction. The 
year of introduction for HFC-134a (mobile air conditioning) was 2007. Thus the emissions 
have been calculated for the period 2007-2014 and increased remarkably for this period 
from 3.17 to 96.43Gg CO2e due to growth of imported refrigeration and air conditioning 
equipment. 

2.4 Description and interpretation of emission trends for indirect GHGs 

Emission estimates for NOx and CO are reported in the CRF as well. This chapter summarizes 
the trends for these gases. The following table shows the indirect gas emissions from 
mainly the AFOLU sector for the years of 1990 and 2014.

2014 were -97.75% below the level of 1990. 

2.4.2 Carbon monoxide (CO)

The main source of CO emissions is burning of biomass in forest land. The CO emissions 
decreased from 63.63 Gg in 1990 to 1.54 Gg in 2014 which resulted from the biomass 
burning in the forest land. In 2014 the CO emissions were -97.58% below the level of 
1990.

3.1 Overview of the sector 

The energy sector of GHG inventory (GHGI) in Mongolia covers two main source 
categories, namely fuel combustion (CRF 1.A) and fugitive emissions (CRF 1.B). Within 
the fuel combustion source category, it had estimated emissions from energy industries 
(electricity generation, combined heat and power generation), manufacturing industries 
and construction (in aggregated manner), transport (civil aviation, road transportation, 
railways), other sectors (commercial/institutional, residential, agriculture/forestry), non-
specified (stationary combustion) and fugitive emissions (coal mining and handling, oil 
production). 

This sector is the main contributor to overall GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) with its 
share of 62.34% and 17,267.79 Gg of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) in 2014. The Figure 3-1 below 
shows the share of each sector in the total GHG emissions excluding LULUCF from the 
year 2014. 

Figure 3-1: The share of each sector in total GHG emissions of Mongolia (excl. LULUCF), 2014

Within the energy sector, energy industries contribute the most percentage to the GHG 
emissions and next two contributors are manufacturing industries and construction, 
and transport sectors each with 54.87%, 13.40%, and 11.57% (see Table 3-1). The share of 
energy industries is relatively constant, e.g. from 46.97% in 1990 increased up to 68.09% 
in 2000 and slightly decreased to 54.87% in 2014. The share of manufacturing industries 
and construction source category is decreased from 22.86% in 1990 to 7.59% in 2000 
and gradually increased up to 13.40% in 2014. This change is linked to the consequences 
of transition from planned to the market economy in the late 90s. In addition to fuel 
combustion, pollution from small sources of residential heating systems and fugitive 
methane emissions from solid fuel transmission/transport/distribution contribute 
significantly to total GHG emissions. The emissions from energy sectors have been 
increased by 55.69% from 11,091.1 Gg CO2e in 1990 to 17,267.8 Gg CO2e in 2014.

* Other sectors include Commercial/Institutional, Residential and Agriculture/Forestry/Fishing source categories. 

The inventory of emissions from fuel combustion includes direct GHG emissions such as 
CO2, CH4, N2O and indirect such as NOx, CO, NMVOCs, and SO2 emissions as well, while 
fugitive emissions from coal and oil production are CO2 and CH4. 

The emissions from international bunkers (CO2, CH4, N2O, SO2 and indirect gases) and CO2 
emission from biomass combustion are included in memo items and not calculated into 
national total. The following Figures 3-2 and 3-3 show the share of GHG emissions by

Figure 3-3: Trend in aggregated emissions by source categories within energy sector 
for the period 1990-2014 (in Gg CO2e)

As in the Figure 3-3 shown, the share of energy industries (mostly electricity and heat 
production) in total fuel combustion source category (CRF 1.A) is the most highest, 
namely 54.87%, within the energy sector followed by manufacturing industries and 
construction with 13.40%, and other sectors where included commercial/Institutional, 
residential, agriculture and forestry categories with 8.24%. The residential category within 
the other sectors (CRF 1.A.4) has the highest share with 83.59% followed by agriculture/
forestry 14.09% and commercial/institutional 2.32% categories in the year of 2014. The 
road transportation represents 83.84% and it is the most important key source with one 
of the highest share on emissions within the transport category. The second important 
source is the railway with 14.12% and the civil aviation source category, from which the 
domestic aviation represents 2.04% (40.72 Gg CO2e). The international aviation bunkers 
will not be calculated in the national total emissions, but reported as memo item with 
42.62 Gg CO2e in 2014. 

Table 3-2 shows emissions of source categories within the energy sector. The GHG 
emission (CH4, N2O) from all categories of energy sector was estimated by using IPCC 
default methodology and combined with default and country specific emission factors 
(CS EFs) for some types of coal.

3.2 Description of source specific categories 

3.2.1 Overview of fuel combustion activities (CRF 1.A)

The Mongolia’s climate is harsh continental with sharply defined four seasons, high 
annual and diurnal temperature fluctuations and low rainfall. Due to thishigh altitude 
(the average altitude is 1,580m above sea level) Mongolia’s climate is generally colder than 
other countries of the same latitude. Average annual temperatures are around +8.5°C 
in the Gobi region and -7.8°C in the high mountainous areas. The extreme minimum 
temperature is -31.1°C to -55.3°C in January and the extreme maximum temperature is 
+28.5°C to +44.0°C in July. 

According to the Ministry of Energy, the current installed power capacity in Mongolia is 
approximately 1,100 MW, with an available capacity about 900 MW. Mongolia has about 8 
coal-fired combined heat and power plants, 600 small diesel generators, 13 hydroelectric 
plants and multiple wind and solar systems. Approximately 95% of the total electricity 
of Mongolia is generated domestically results from coal-fired CHPs, 0.1% from diesel 
systems, 2.7% from wind and solar power, 1.5% from hydropower as of 2016. Mongolia 
imports about 20% of its annual electricity demand mainly from Russia and to a lesser 
extent, from China. In the year of 2016 Mongolia’s energy production has increased by 
2.98% from previous years (ERC, 2016). 

For this category, the activity data was gathered mainly from National statistics office 
(NSO) of Mongolia, relevant ministries and agencies such as Ministry of energy, Ministry 
of road and transport development, Ministry of mining and heavy industry, and the 
Mongolian civil aviation authority. International sources such as International Energy 
Agency (IEA) statistics were used to fill data gaps. Not all required data were available, 
therefore with the help of additional statistics and various assumptions some data were 
disaggregated and supplemented in the respective sectors of energy transformation and 
final consumption. The energy balance in Mongolia is not well developed, so the fuel 
consumption in manufacturing industries was not possible to disaggregate. Same case 
for transport sectors, the gasoline and diesel consumption for respective vehicle types 
were taken and imported to the amount of these fuels. 

Total aggregated emissions from fuel combustion, including transport, based on sectorial 
approach represented 16,111.16 Gg of CO2e in 2014. 

The following Table 3-3 gives an overview of emission sources. 



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 3

Energy (CRF 1)

Table 3-3: Emission sources for the disaggregation of the energy balance

Balance of emission sources 

Emission sources are: 

• public combined heat and power plants (CHPs),
• hard coal mining, 
• brown coal mining,
• heat only boilers (HOBs),
• small diesel power plants,
• Ulaanbaatar railways (UBTZ),
• Mongolian railways, 
• Mongolian airlines (MIAT),
• other mining and manufacturing industries, 
• household stoves,
• vehicles,


Plant types are:

• combined heat and power plants (CHPs),
• steam turbine power plants, 
• diesel power plants,
• heat only boilers (HOBs), 


According to energy sources: 

• coal: coking coal, other bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal, lignite, 
• diesel oil,






Since there is no disaggregated coal data in the national statistics, disaggregated data 
from International Energy Agency (IEA) statistics were used. The Ministry of Energy 
(MOE) and the National statistics office of Mongolia (NSO) are working currently on the 
development of the energy balance table of Mongolia. 

Due to unavailability of the disaggregated data of fuel consumption within the 
manufacturing industries and construction (CRF 1.A.2) category the liquid (diesel oil) and 
solid fuel (coal) consumption data for different industries were taken as aggregated data. 

In the transport category (CRF 1.A.3) as well as the activity data like fuel consumption 
data of road transportation was unavailable to disaggregate by vehicle types nationwide, 
therefore the activity data were taken as the sum consumption of motor gasoline and 
diesel oil. The distinction of jet fuel consumption between international and domestic 
aviation was relatively complicated due to lack of activity data from the Ministry of 
Road and Transport Development (former Ministry of Road and Transportation, MRT) 
and Mongolian Civil Aviation Authority (MCAA). Therefore the jet fuel consumption of 
international and domestic aviation has been calculated using the flight number of 
domestic flights and international landing and take-off numbers from national statistics. 
The activity data in railways have been requested from the MRTD and disaggregated 
into the diesel oil consumption for locomotives and coal (mostly sub-bituminous coal) 
consumption for passenger wagon heating (only in heating season, which lasts almost 
7 months). 

Other sectors (CRF 1.A.4) include the fuel consumption in commercial and institutional, 
residential and agriculture/forestry/fishing subcategories. In the agriculture (CRF 1.A.4.c) 
subcategory coal, diesel oil and other primary solid biomass were consumed by stationary 
appliances and diesel oil by off-road vehicles and other machineries.

CHAPTER 3

Energy (CRF 1)

3.2.2 Feedstock and non-energy use of fuels 

For a number of applications, mainly in larger industrial processes, fossil hydrocarbons 
are not only used as energy sources, but also have other uses e.g. feedstock, lubricants, 
solvents, etc. The sectorial approaches (Tier 1, 2 and 3) are therefore based on fuel 
combustion statistics. 

In the case of Mongolia, the lubricants use has been reported in the Industrial Processes 
and Product Use (IPPU) sector under non-energy products from fuels and solvent use 
(CRF 2.D) source category, not under fuel combustion category (CRF 1.A) in the energy 
sector. 

3.2.3 Fugitive emissions from solid fuels (CRF 1.B)

In Mongolia, the fugitive emissions from fuels occur in the coal mining and handling, 
and oil industries. Mongolia does not have yet any petroleum refining industries. The 
fugitive emissions from fuels were calculated from the surface mining industry, because 
the underground mines are not occurring in Mongolia. 

The crude oil production has started from 1996 in Mongolia, back then, the amount 
of explored oil was around 2 thousand cubic meters and in 2014 was 1.2 million cubic 
meters. Approximately 5.9 million tons of oil was explored in Mongolia between 1996 and 
2016. The explored crude oil is exported directly to China. There are three major oil fields 
in Mongolia, namely Toson-Uul XIX (field name), Tamsag XXI which are located in Dornod 
province of Mongolia and operated by PetroChina Daqing Tamsag LLC, and Tsagaan els 
which is located in Dornogobi province and operated by Dongsheng Petroleum LLC 
(MRPAM, 2017). 

The overview of total fugitive emissions from fuels has been presented in the following 
figure. 

Figure 3-4: Total fugitive emissions from fuels for the period 1990-2014



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 3

Energy (CRF 1)

From the figure, it can be seen that the 
fugitive emissions from coal mining and 
handling were relatively constant until 
2011 and further have been slightly 
declining. On the contrary, the fugitive 
emissions from oil production have 
risen steadily. Over the years the share 
of fugitive emissions from solid fuels 
represent 64% and from crude oil 36%. 

3.2.4 International aviation bunkers (CRF 1.A.3.a)

This category includes emissions from the international aviation (CRF 1.A.3.a.i). These 
emissions are excluded from the national totals. 

The history of Mongolian airlines (MIAT) has begun from 1925 and is inseparably linked 
with the history of Mongolian Air Force. The first ever freighter Y-13 which was donated 
by the former Soviet Union, has landed on 25th of May 1925 in Mongolia. This day is 
considered as the foundation of Mongolian Air Force. Later 1956 was the new era in the 
development of Mongolian civil aviation. In early 1956, five AN-2 aircrafts were delivered 
from Soviet Union and with the successful completion of the training for pilots, Mongolia 
was able to carry out regularly scheduled flights. From 1987 MIAT started its international 
operation with TU-154 aircraft to Moscow, Irkutsk of Soviet Union and to Beijing which 
was leased from Soviet Union (MIAT, 2017). 

Mongolia remains committed to the strategic objectives of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) with respect to its goal of enhancing the global aviation safety and 
security, improving efficiency of aviation operations, minimizing adverse environmental 
impacts from air transport and strengthening the laws governing civil aviation. 

Mongolia’s air transport industry is focusing on passenger and air cargo markets. Air 
passenger transport is the most important aviation activity and counts 340,024 passengers 
in the domestic market, and 781,000 in the international market (by 2012). While air traffic 
has actually declined in the domestic market since 1993 (in total 8.6% by 2012), it has 
been increased more than seven times in the international market in that same period. 

As of 2012, there are twenty-two airports (except only one international and others 
are domestic) in Mongolia, three of them are private airports and nineteen airports are 
owned and operated by the Mongolian Civil Aviation Authority (MCAA). Sixteen airports 
are considered operational and six others are no longer functional for regular flights. 
Chinggis Khaan International Airport is the only international airport in Mongolia, but 
from 2013 a Mongolian-Japanese joint project to build a New Ulaanbaatar International 
Airport was started in the Tuv province around 50 km from capital city and it will be 
commissioned in 2017, while the official beginning of the operation is in 2018 (ICAO, 
2013).

CHAPTER 3

Energy (CRF 1)

The Mongolian Civil Aviation Authority (MCAA) has an overall responsibility for the 
aviation sector in Mongolia. The GHG emissions from international aviation bunkers can 
be seen from the Figure 3-6. 

Figure 3-6: GHG emissions from international aviation bunkers for the period 1990-2014

From the trend of GHG emissions in international aviation bunkers can be seen two 
major rises and declines. On the one hand along the economic growth and downturn in 
international and domestic flight numbers are changing and this has an influence to the 
GHG emissions in this sector. The sharp rise from 2005 to 2006 caused by: 

- Eznis Airways LLC was established on January 6th 2006 with the investment of 
Newcom Group which is one the biggest groups in Mongolia, and imported the 
airplane SAAB-340B which was produced in Sweden. It has started its operation 
officially for the domestic flights. Thus the domestic flight number has been 
increased. 

- In 2006 total passenger transportation increased by 16% than previous year. 

The sharp decline from 2008 to 2009 caused by: 

- World economic downturn,

- Growth of the U.S. dollar compared to national currency, 

- Increase of fuel prices, 

- Aero Mongolia LLC stopped its operation for the domestic flights due to lack of 
aircraft and was suspended in 2009, 

- Due to these the passenger transportation decreased by 11%. 

According to IPCC 2006 the Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods use fuel consumption data. Tier 1 is 
purely fuel based, while Tier 2 method is based on the number of landing/take-off cycles 
(LTOs) and fuel use. Tier 3 uses movement data for individual flights. 

In the case of Mongolia, the jet fuel consumption and sold data were not available for the 
period of 1990-2014. Therefore the number of LTOs has been used for the GHG emissions 
from jet fuel consumption. 



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 3

Energy (CRF 1)

The GHG emissions estimation was performed based on the flight numbers, which were 
requested from the MCAA. The activity data is basically the international flight numbers 
of LTO cycles and domestic flight numbers. The international LTO cycles and domestic 
flight numbers were added together and from this the percentages have been calculated. 
These percentages of international LTOs and domestic flight numbers were multiplied 
with the numbers of imported jet fuel amount and this way the fuel consumption for 
international and domestic aviation has been estimated. 

The one of two jet fuel trading companies the A-Jet Limited LLC was founded in 2004, with 
the activity operations such as crude oil (incl. jet fuel) imports and activities in agricultural 
and mining sectors. The activity data request from A-Jet Limited LLC on jet fuel sold was 
requested for the period 1990-2014, but we received data for the period 2004-2014. For 
the remaining years 1990-2003 there are 14 years to estimate missing years with a long 
term extrapolation which is not a good practice. Thus after a consultation with experts, 
for time series consistency it was decided to use flight numbers to estimate and calculate 
the fuel consumption for international and domestic aviation. 

The overview of the jet fuel consumption and GHG emissions during 1990-2014 is 
presented in the Table 3-4.

3.3 Comparison of the Sectorial Approach (SA) with the Reference Approach (RA)

In the context of international climate protection, the reporting on fuel combustion 
related CO2 emissions due to the dominant share of the total emissions are of the utmost 
importance. 

The Reference Approach (RA) is a top-down approach, using a country’s energy supply 
data to calculate the CO2 emissions from mainly fossil fuels combustion. The RA is a 
straightforward method that can be applied on the basis of relatively easily available 
energy supply statistics. Excluded carbon has increased the requirements for data to 
some extent. However, improved comparability between the sectorial and reference 
approaches continues to allow a country to produce a second independent estimate of 
CO2 emissions from fuel combustion with limited additional efforts and data requirements 
(IPCC, 2006). 

The RA is designed to calculate the emissions of CO2 from fuel combustion, starting from 
high level of energy supply data. The assumption is that carbon is conserved so that, 
for example, carbon in crude oil is equal to the total carbon content of all the derived 
products. The RA does not distinguish between different source categories within the 
energy sector and only total CO2 emissions from source category of fuel combustion (CRF 
1.A) (IPCC, 2006). 

The RA has been executed for all inventory years from 1990 until 2014. The basis for this 
is essentially provided by the figures for the national energy balances on primary energy 
consumption, but in the case of Mongolia it is provided by coal balances of national and 
IEA statistics. 

The results of the RA are summarized and compared with SA in the Tables 3-5. 3-7 
below. The difference of energy consumption for total fuels between the RA and SA 
gives an average deviation of -0.35% over all the years and the average difference of CO2 
emissions between RA and SA is 2.29% over all the years. 

Based on the IPCC methodology, RA in apparent consumption of fuels was estimated 
after consideration of carbon stored in iron and steel industry.

3.4 Methodological issues 

3.4.1 Methods used 

The current submission of Mongolia’s GHG inventory was conducted using the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006) and software. Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 methods, default and country specific emission factors (EFs) and net calorific values 
(NCVs) were used for the GHG emissions estimation from energy sectors. 



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 3

Energy (CRF 1)

3.4.2 Emission factors (EFs) and net calorific values (NCVs) used 

The net calorific values (NCVs) for some coal types were estimated by national experts, 
e.g. the country specific NCVs for coking coal, sub-bituminous coal, and lignite and brown 
coal briquettes were taken from the report “Studies on country specific GHG emission and 
removal factors for Mongolia”, 2014. This report is the output of 2 years research project, 
which has been implemented for the period of 2011-2013 and published in 2014, by 
the order of the Ministry of Environment and Green Development (MEGD) of Mongolia. 
This project was the first project in Mongolia which studied and estimated the country 
specific emission factors (EFs) for some types of coal in energy sector, EFs for some types 
of animals in agriculture sector and the waste generation rate, the composition of waste 
and the fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) disposed to solid waste disposal sites 
(SWDS) in the waste sector in Mongolia. These country specific EFs were taken for GHG 
emission estimations of energy and waste sectors. NCVs for other liquid fuels were taken 
as default values from the IPCC 2006. 

Same as NCVs for some coal types, the country specific emission factors for CO2 were 
estimated by national experts and can be found in the above mentioned report. The 
emission factors of all fuels (solid and liquid) for CH4 and N2O were used the default values 
from IPCC 2006. 

In the Table 3-8 below there are listed the EFs and NCVs used in GHG inventory estimation.

CHAPTER 3

Energy (CRF 1)

3.5 Sector specific recalculations

The previous GHG inventory estimations have been conducted in accordance with 
revised IPCC 1996 guidelines, but starting with the preparation of iBUR inventory, the 
team has decided to change the methodology to 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006). The aim of the change is: a) to improve quality 
of GHG inventory; b) comparability with other countries, c) accuracy and analysis of the 
activity data, d) choice of default emission factors. 

In the previous GHG inventories (e.g. estimated during the submission of SNC) the 
consumption of lubricants was calculated under the fuel combustion category, but for 
this inventory it was calculated under the non-energy products from fuels and solvent 
use category (CRF 2.D) of IPPU sector. Thus the results from the base year 1990 over 
the years the two methodologies differ slightly, namely the emissions from previous 
inventory which was calculated by using the revised IPCC 1996 are slightly higher than 
the emissions which was calculated by using IPCC 2006. This can be explained by the 
difference of NCVs, EFs and activity data used. The table below shows the recalculated 
GHG emissions of initial Biennial update report (iBUR) compared to the Second national 
communication (SNC).

3.6 Sector specific QA/QC and verification 

In accordance with IPCC 2006, volume 1, chapter 6 the quality control (QC) has been done 
within the inventory team. Sector specific QA/QC plan is based on the general QA/QC 
rules and activities in specific categories. The sector specific QC activities were performed 
directly during the GHG emissions calculations (the GHG emissions calculation has been 
done by the 2006 IPCC Inventory Software) such as checking several data sources and 
data inputs into the software, including the QC for the EFs and other parameters as well. 

The main source of activity data of GHG emissions estimation is the National statistics office 
of Mongolia (NSO). Generally the NSO collects and consolidates data from organizations/
institutions and producers by questionnaires at the national level. 

For the activity data collection of GHG emissions estimation the questionnaires, in the 
form of official letters, were sent to the relevant government and private organizations/
institutions in order to compare and ensure with the data from NSO. The data collected 



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 3

Energy (CRF 1)

and published by NSO from the relevant government and private organizations/
institutions, in most cases differ from the data directly provided by those organizations/
institutions. The IPCC 2006 recommends if there are several sources of the activity data 
available, it is a good practice to follow the data from national statistics. 

3.7 Sector specific planned improvements 

Especially in this sector the energy balance table and the disaggregation of fuel 
consumption (e.g. coal disaggregation, liquid fuel disaggregation in the transport 
source category and jet fuel consumption in international and domestic aviation) is very 
important. Mongolia does not have a proper energy balance table, but the experts of 
energy sector is going to develop it in the near future. Mongolia has just started a project 
with Japan through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Mongolia’s 
GHG inventory system improvement and capacity building. The duration of the project 
is from the end of 2017 until early 2020. With the implementation of this project, it is 
planned to improve the Mongolia’s GHG inventory system, the institutional arrangement 
of GHG inventory, data collection process, capacity building, and all these issues should be 
applied specifically in energy (the energy balance table will be in some part developed) 
and LULUCF sectors.

4.1 Sector overview 

The GHG emissions from IPPU sector cover emissions estimation from mineral industry 
(CRF 2.A), metal industry (CRF 2.C), non-energy products from fuels and solvent use (CRF 
2.D), and product uses like substitutes for ozone depleting substances (CRF 2.F). The 
rest of the activities under IPPU sector were excluded from the inventory because they 
either do not occur in Mongolia or there was no sufficient data for use. For example, the 
chemical and electronics industries are not occurring in Mongolia. The CO2 and HFCs 
were the main direct GHGs estimated and reported under IPPU sector. 

4.2 Summary of the IPPU sector activities 

The main contributor to the total emissions from IPPU sector is the mineral industry 
(cement and lime production). The share of mineral industry in the total GHG emissions of 
IPPU sector was around 69% in 2014. As a second contributor to the total emissions were 
the emissions from the use of fluorinated substitutes for ozone depleting substances 
(CRF 2.F) and represents around 29% (see Figure 4-1).

According to the table above, the metal industry occurs in Mongolia since 1995 and GHG 
emissions from this source category for the period 1990-1995 have not been estimated. 
Regarding the GHG emissions from product uses as substitutes for ozone depleting 
substances, the activity data were available only from 2012, so the emissions have been 
back-calculated to the introduction year. According to IPCC 2006, volume 3, part 2, if Tier 
1 method was applied for emissions estimation from HFCs, then it back-calculates the 
development of banks of a refrigerant from the current reporting year to the year of its 
introduction. The year of introduction for HFC-134a (mobile air conditioning) was 2007.

Figure 4-2: GHG emissions from IPPU sector by source categories, Gg CO2e

From the Figure 4-3 can be seen two major rises in 2010 and in 2014. In Mongolia there 
were two main cement plants operating until 2013 namely Darkhan cement plant, 
built in 1968 and Khutul cement plant, built in 1982. Both had a wet cement processing 
technology. In 2014, the Khutul cement plant introduced the dry processing technology 
and started its operations generating a capacity of 1 million tons of cement per year. 
From 2008-2009 there was an economic downturn in Mongolia and after this, in 2010 the 
economy has grown back.

4.2.1 Mineral Industry (CRF 2.A)

The mineral industry of Mongolia covered cement and lime productions. As stated above 
the share of mineral industry in the IPPU sector was relatively high (94%) from the base 
year and over the years it has slightly declined (69%) until 2014, because in this year, 
the shares of other source categories (e.g. metal industry and the use of F-gases) have 
increased. Cement and lime production share the emissions of the mineral industry 
respectively 56% and 13%. 

Cement is manufactured from limestone through a closely controlled chemical 
combination of calcium, silicon, aluminium, iron and other ingredients. During the 
cement production process, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is heated in a cement kiln 
at a high temperature of about 1,450°C to form lime and CO2 in a process known as 
calcination. Then the lime is combined with silica-containing materials to produce 
clinker (an intermediate product), with the earlier by-product CO2 being released to the 
atmosphere. The clinker is then allowed to cool, mixed with a small amount of gypsum 
and potentially other materials (e.g. slag), and used to make a Portland cement. 

Until 2013 two main cement plants were operating in Mongolia, namely Darkhan 
cement plant which was built in 1968 and Khutul cement plant built in 1982. These two 
plants used a wet-processing technology for cement production until 2014. From 2014 
they shifted the technology from wet- to dry-processing as a result of implementation 
of Mongolia’s Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Khutul cement plant 
capacity increased to one million tons of cement per year with the new processing 
technology. However, Mongolia does not meet its cement demand as shown in the 
Figure 4-4.

CHAPTER 4

Industrial Processes and Product Use (CRF 2)

The GHG emissions have been estimated not from directly cement production, but from 
clinker production. The activity data for cement production has been provided by the 
Ministry of Industry (MOI, former) by official letter and survey. MOI collects limestone 
extraction, clinker and cement production data from producers in thousand tons. The 
extracted limestone is the main raw material in the clinker production. According to 
experts of MOI, since the limestone is the main ingredient of clinker, to get a clinker data, 
limestone should be decreased by 1.6 times. The CO2 emissions from cement (clinker) 
and lime production can be seen from Table 4-3.

4.2.2 Metal Industry (CRF 2.C)

The metal industry source category has covered the iron and steel production. Other 
metallurgical productions are not occurring in Mongolia. Steel production occurs in 
Mongolia in secondary facilities, which produce steel mainly from recycled steel scrap and 
not from an iron ore. This kind of steelmaking occurs in electric arc furnaces (EAFs). The 
majority of CO2 emissions from this sector come from the utilization of metallurgical coke 
in the production of pig iron and from the consumption of other process by-products at 
the iron and steel mill. Activity data on iron and steel production (production of cast steel1 
and steel bloom2) were obtained from the National statistics office of Mongolia (NSO) 
which collects data from producers. According to experts’ judgment, the data on steel 
bloom have been taken for the CO2 emissions estimation from steel production in EAFs. 
The default EFs and Tier 1 method of IPCC 2006 were used for emissions estimations from 
the metal industry. The iron and steel production contributes to the total emissions from 
IPPU sector at around 2% (see Figure 4-1, Table 4-4).

4.2.3 Non-energy products from fuels and solvent use (CRF 2.D)

In this source, categories have been included only of GHG emissions from lubricant use 
in industrial and transport applications. Mongolia imports lubricants, because there are 
no oil refineries. Lubricants can be used for a variety of purposes, namely motor oils and 
industrial oils, greases which differ in terms of physical characteristics, and commercial 
applications. It’s complicated to determine which fraction of lubricant is consumed in 
machinery and in vehicles which is actually combusted and emitted as CO2 emissions. 
Therefore, it has been assumed that all amount of imported lubricants consumed as 
motor and industrial oils. The assumption is that all amount of l imported lubricant is 
consumed in the same year. The CO2 emissions from this source category can be seen 
from Table 4-5 below.

4.2.4 Product uses as substitutes for ozone depleting substances (CRF 2.F)

Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are serving as alternatives 
to ozone depleting substances (ODS) being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. 
Current and expected application areas of HFCs and PFCs include: 

- refrigeration and air conditioning; 

- fire suppression and explosion protection; 

- aerosols;

- solvent cleaning;



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 4

Industrial Processes and Product Use (CRF 2)

- foam blowing agents; and

- other applications. 

In Mongolia the emissions from this source category include HFCs emissions from 
following application areas: 

- refrigeration (stationary, mobile) and air conditioning (stationary, mobile);

- fire suppression and explosion protection; and 

- foam blowing agents. 

Mongolia is an importing country of all the above mentioned applications. The emissions 
from the fluorinated substitutes for ODS were estimated from the following HFCs such as 
HFC-23, HFC-32, HFC-125, HFC-134a, HFC-143a and HFC-152a in Mongolia. 

The HFCs consumption inventory was conducted in accordance with terms of reference 
on “Conducting HFCs Inventory and Survey of ODS Alternatives”, approved by the Decree 
No. A/185 of State Secretary of MEGDT (former MET), dated on 26th May 2016. This 
inventory was done by National Ozone Authority (NOA) of the Ministry of Environment 
and Tourism (MET) of Mongolia in cooperation with United Nations Environmental 
Program (UNEP) and Climate and Clean Air Coalition-HFC Initiative (CCAC) for the period 
2012-2015. 

The consumption of HFCs was taken from Table 1 of the project “Report for HFC inventory 
and identification of opportunities for introduction of low-GWP alternatives in Mongolia”. 
Following table provides the main applications areas for HFCs which have been counted 
in Mongolia.

CHAPTER 4

Industrial Processes and Product Use (CRF 2)

The activity data for the estimation of HFCs emissions were available only from 2012 to 
2014. Therefore the emissions have been estimated only for the last few years. For the 
emissions estimation from HFCs was used Tier 1 method of IPCC 2006 which is using 
the default emission factors. The Tier 1 method then back-calculates the development of 
banks of a refrigerant from the current reporting year to the year of its introduction. The 
year of introduction for HFC-134a (mobile air conditioning) was 2007 and for other HFCs 
(23, 32, 143a, 152a) was 2010. Thus, the emissions have been calculated for the period 
2007-2014 and increased remarkably for this period from 3.17 to 96.43Gg CO2e due to 
growth of imported refrigeration and air conditioning equipment (Figure 4-6).

substances (HFCs), 2007-2014, Gg CO2e

4.3 Emission factors and global warming potentials used 

Emission factors (EFs) used in GHG emissions estimations of IPPU sector was taken by 
default values from IPCC 2006 and global warming potentials (GWPs) for HFCs were taken 
from 1995 IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). Table 4-8 provides the 100-year GWPs 
of HFCs.

4.4 Sector specific recalculations 

The previous GHG inventory estimations have been conducted in accordance with revised 
1996 GL, but starting with the preparation of iBUR inventory team has decided to change 
the methodology to 2006 IPCC GL. The advantages to use latest methodology are e.g.: a) 
the improvement of country’s GHG inventory, b) comparability with other countries, c) 
accuracy and analysis of the activity data, d) choice of default emission factors. 

The changes of GHG emissions estimations from IPPU sector can be explained as follows: 

1. In previous GHG inventory (during SNC) the GHG emissions have been calculated 
from:

- CO2 emissions from cement production, 

- CO2 emissions cast steel and steel bloom production (for metal industry – iron and 
steel production), 

- HFCs emissions from local and mobile refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, 
and cars (activity data as imported numbers from national statistics), 

- NMVOCs from food and beverage production.

2. In this GHG inventory (during iBUR) the GHG emissions have been calculated from:

- CO2 emissions from clinker production, 

- CO2 emissions from steel bloom production (for metal industry – iron and steel 
production),

- CO2 emissions from lubricant use (for non-energy products from fuels and solvent 
use), 

- HFCs consumption data from the inventory “Report for HFCs inventory and 
identification of opportunities for introduction of low-GWP alternatives in 
Mongolia”3 (activity data for consumption of HFCs were available from 2012).

The default EFs were used for both emissions calculations. The table 4-9 shows the 
recalculated GHG emissions of initial Biennial update report (iBUR) compared to Second 
national communication (SNC) of Mongolia.

4.5 Sector specific QA/QC and verification

In accordance with IPCC 2006, volume 1, chapter 6 the quality control (QC) has been done 
within the inventory team. Sector specific QA/QC plan is based on the general QA/QC 
rules and activities in specific categories. The sector specific QC activities were performed 
directly during the GHG emissions calculation (the GHG emissions calculation has been 
done by the 2006 IPCC Inventory Software) such as checking several data sources and 
data inputs into the software, including the QC for the EFs and other parameters as well. 

The main source of activity data of GHG emissions estimation is the National statistics office 
of Mongolia (NSO). Generally the NSO collects and consolidates data from organizations/
institutions and producers by questionnaires at national level. 

For the activity data collection of GHG emissions estimation the questionnaires, in the 
form of official letters, were sent to the relevant government and private organizations/
institutions in order to compare and ensure with data from NSO. The data collected and 
published by NSO from the relevant government and private organizations/institutions, 
in most cases differ from the data directly provided by those organizations/institutions. 
The IPCC 2006 recommends if there is availability of several sources of the activity data. 
Generally, it’s a good practice to follow the data from national statistics. 

4.6 Sector specific planned improvements 

Some significant improvements in IPPU sector in the short and medium term are 
required. The improvements planned in the following areas: (i) additional activity data 
(AD) collection to improve the completeness; (ii) accuracy and disaggregation of the AD; 
(iii) AD collection system, processing and analysis;(iv) capacity building and institutional 
arrangement. The medium term improvements are to improve the inventory of HFCs and 
PFCs. For this submission, the activity data on HFCs were taken from the HFCs inventory 
report (stated above).

5.1 Overview of sector

The GHG inventory for the agriculture sector is conducted for three categories: enteric 
fermentation, manure management, and aggregated sources and non-CO2 emissions 
on land. The GHG emissions from these three categories were directly dependent on 
the livestock population in the country. Even though, there are four discrete source 
categories in the Mongolian agriculture sector as follows: (i) extensive livestock, which 
is the traditional semi-nomadic pastoral system, where camels, horses, cattle, sheep and 
goats are grazed together; (ii) mechanized large-area crop production of cereals and 
fodder crops; (iii) intensive farming, producing potatoes and other vegetables, with both 
mechanized and simple production methods; and (iv) intensive livestock, with housed 
dairy cattle, pigs and poultry. The livestock sector dominates, contributing 84.9% of total 
agricultural production. Since the 1990s, the total number of animals generally increased 
and reached 52,159.6 thous.heads in 2014. However, there is a unique natural disaster to 
Mongolia named zud/dzud in which large numbers of livestock die occasionally due to 
severe, cold winter. In 1999-2000, 2000-2001 and 2001-2002, Mongolia was hit by three 
dzuds in a row, in which 3,341.4 thous.heads (10%), 4,152.2 thous.heads (14%), 2,177.6 
thous.heads (8%) animals were lost respectively excluding swine and poultry population 
number. The second harsh winter within GHG inventory period of 1990-2014 happened 
in 2009-2010, and over 11 million livestock lost and decreased by circa 26% from previous 
year’s total. As a result, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from domestic livestock 
fluctuates following those long and short term impact. The livestock numbers between 
1990 and 2014 are given in the Table 5-1 by animal category.

In 2014, agriculture sector accounted for 48.44% (16.726.97 Gg CO2e) of total national 
direct GHG emissions (without LULUCF), being the second major source of GHG emissions 
after the ‘Energy’ sector in the country (Figure 5-1). 

Figure 5-1: CO2e emissions from the agriculture sector compared to the total GHG emissions 
(excl. LULUCF) in Mongolia in 2014

Within the agriculture sector, enteric fermentation contributes the highest to the GHG 
emissions with circa 57.33% followed by aggregated sources and non-CO2 emissions 
sources on land (41.17%) and manure management with 1.5% (Table 5-2).

Agriculture (CRF 3)

Between 1990 and 2014, the total GHG emissions originated from the agriculture sector 
tended to higher values, increasing by 58.02%, from 10,585.29 to 16.726.97 Gg CO2e 
(Table 5-3), in particular, due to increasing number of domestic livestock which increased 
25,856.9 million to 51,982.7 million in 1990-2014. However, animal numbers fluctuated 
within the inventory period due to the dzud occurrence as explained above (Figure 5-2).

5.1.2 Methodological Issues

In the Agriculture sector of Mongolia’s 2017 GHG inventory submission, the IPCC 2006 
Guidelines have been used. Generally, emissions from Livestock (CRF 3.A) and Aggregated 
sources and non-CO2 emissions sources on land (CRF 3.C) were estimated using the Tier 
1 methodological approach and default EFs values. Obtainable country specific activity 
data for all the categories were used. Where country specific activity data were non-
existent, data from international data source (FAOSTAT) were used. 

A summary description of methods used to estimate emissions by categories is provided 
in Table 5-5, while a more detailed description is available in chapters 5.2-5.3 of the NIR.

5.1.3 Uncertainties Assessment and time series consistency

Uncertainties related to estimation of methane emissions from ‘Livestock’, in particular 
depend on the accuracy of the livestock characteristic, and also on the emission factors 
used. The uncertainty associated with livestock populations will vary widely depending 
the on source, but should be known within +20% (IPCC 2006, section 10.2.3, page 10.23). 
As the emission factors for the Tier 1 method are not based on country specific data, 
they may not accurately represent a country’s livestock characteristics, and may be 
highly uncertain as a result. Emission factors of enteric fermentation was estimated using 
the Tier 1 method are unlikely to be known more accurately than +30% and may be 
uncertain to +50% (IPCC 2006, section 10.3.4, page 10.33). The uncertainty range for the 
default factors related to estimation of methane emissions from manure management is 



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 5

Agriculture (CRF 3)

estimated to be +30% (IPCC 2006, section 10.4.4 page, 10.48). Emissions are estimated by 
using consistent estimation methods and data sources. 

Uncertainties in estimates of direct and indirect N2O emissions from managed soils are 
caused by uncertainties related to the emission factors, natural variability, partitioning 
fractions, activity data, lack of measurements, spatial aggregation, and lack of information 
on specific on-farm practices. IPCC 2006, Table 11.1 and 11.3 are used for the uncertainty 
analysis for the N2O emissions from managed soils.

5.1.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control

In the current submission, all applied information and data have been double-checked 
as far as possible. For instance, the activity data (AD) of livestock numbers is taken from 
Statistical yearbooks of Agriculture cross-checked against the National Statistic Office 
website information. GHG emissions were estimated using AD and default factors and 
parameters from official sources of reference. The AD and methods used to estimate GHG 
emissions under this sector were documented and archived both in hard copies and 
electronically. For the next submission an overall quality control and quality assurance 
system should be in place. This system will describe transparently the involved agencies 
and roles, data flows and calculation methods.

5.1.5 Source specific recalculations

A recalculation in this category is not done in this submission, due to the implementation 
of a complete new National System for Greenhouse Gas Inventories and thus, the first 
time application of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and incorporation of most recent data 
collection methods (and first time application of their methodological approach). Thus, 
compared to earlier versions of the Mongolian GHG Inventory, the whole inventory can 
be considered as recalculated. 

The previous GHG inventories in the first National Communication in 2001 and the 
second National Communication in 2010 are based on the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines 
for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (revised IPCC 1996). That prevents the results 
from being easily comparable. Nevertheless Table 5-6 shows the differences over time.

5.1.7 Sector specific planned improvements

Mongolian livestock is a local indigenous breed of animals with very low productivity 
and small sized compared to the other breeds of animals in the world. Mongolia’s animal 
husbandry has been nomadic pastoralist, with livestock herding on natural pasture, 
even in winter time. Moreover, the climate in Mongolia influences the type of forage 
and the amount digested by livestock annually. The emission from enteric fermentation 
source category significantly contributes to national greenhouse gas inventory and it 
is a key category. Thus, the highest priority of planned improvements could include 
obtaining detailed country specific data on gross energy and methane conversion factor 
for livestock source categories. Additionally, Mongolia’s livestock manure is almost 100 
percent deposited on pastures and rangelands, thus it tends to decompose under more 
aerobic conditions and less CH4 is produced and hence detailed research is needed to 
provide a clarification of this issue. 

The emission factors (EFs) of CH4 for enteric fermentation and manure management 
have been developed for Mongolian specific conditions using Tier 2 method by the

local experts (Namkhainyam et al., 2014). However, in this submission, those developed 
EFs were not used due to high uncertainty of the input parameters used. At present 
planning a reassessment with updated raw data of livestock survey is collected in 2016-
2017 by National Statistics Office (currently results are not yet finalized) and apply for the 
subsequent submissions of BUR and NCs. 

Planned improvements within the agriculture sector are listed below in Table 5-8. The 
last submission did not undergo any official review, thus the improvements mentioned 
here became obvious during the preparation of this submission.

5.2 Livestock (CRF 3.A)

Emissions from livestock are generated through enteric fermentation and manure 
management from domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, camels, horses and 
swine. In 2014, the total emissions from livestock were 9,840.04 Gg CO2e which represented 
58.83% of the total Agricultural emissions. In general, the total livestock emissions 
showed an increasing trend from 6,485.90 Gg CO2e in 1990 to 9,840.04 Gg CO2e in 2014. 
The observed growing level of emissions was due to rising animal populations. However, 
there were a two times sharp decrease of the livestock number in 1999-2002 and 2009-
2010 due to high number of livestock loss during the harsh winter season named “dzud” 
explained in the overview of the Agricultural sector section. Thus, livestock emissions in 
these years declined and gradually increased back in the next following years (Figure 5-3).

5.2.1 Enteric fermentation (CRF 3.A1)

5.2.1.1 Source category description

Methane is produced in herbivores as a by-product of enteric fermentation, a digestive 
process by which carbohydrates are broken down by micro-organisms into simple 
molecules for absorption into the bloodstream. The amount of methane that is released 
depends on the type of digestive tract, age, and weight of the animal, and the quality and 
quantity of the feed consumed. Ruminant livestock (e.g., cattle, sheep) are major sources 
of methane with moderate amounts produced from non-ruminant livestock (e.g., pigs, 
horses). The ruminant gut (rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum) structure fosters 
extensive enteric fermentation of their diet (IPCC 2006, page 10.24). 

5.2.1.2 Summary of emission trends

The total emissions attributed to enteric fermentation was 9,588.82 Gg CO2e making up 
97% of the total livestock emissions in 2014. This was 51.95% and 15.54% above 1990 
and 2013 levels respectively (Table 5-9). Main driver of the emission fluctuation of the 
enteric fermentation between 1990 and 2014 is loss of livestock population during 
natural disasters (see in overview of the agricultural sector). The Figure 5-4 shows that 
total methane emissions from enteric fermentation by livestock type. 

Figure 5-4: Total emission trend from enteric fermentation of livestock

In 1990, cattle contributed 45% of the total emissions from enteric fermentation (Figure

CHAPTER 5

Agriculture (CRF 3)

5-5). The rest were as follows: sheep (25%), horses (14%), camels (8%), goats (8%) and 
swine (0.04%). By 2014, percentage share of the each livestock contribution to the enteric 
fermentation is changed as follows: cattle (35%), sheep (25%), horses (12%), camels (4%), 
goats (24%) and swine (0.01%).

Figure 5-5: Each livestock contribution to the enteric fermentation 
emission in 1990 and 2014

Over the period under review, emission trend from each livestock category showed 
different patterns of change compared with the base year. By 2014, the percentage of 
such categories as camel and swine decreased compared to 1990 year level, while the 
percentage of other categories such as cattle, sheep, goats and horses increased (Table 
5-10).

5.2.1.3 Activity data, methodological issues and emission factors

Emissions from enteric fermentation were calculated at Tier 1, following IPCC 2006 Vol. 4, 
Ch. 10 methodology according to the formula:

Emission = A * EF

Where:

Emission = GHG emissions, in kg CH4 yr-1;

A = Activity data, representing the number of livestock in heads (1);

EF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in units of kg CH4 head-1 yr-1 (2).

(1) Activity data cover the following animal categories: cattle, horses, camels, sheep, goats, 
swine and poultry. For the period between 1990 and 2014, the activity data are taken from 
Statistical yearbooks of agriculture 1990-2014. For dairy cattle, in Mongolia, specialized 
dairy breeds are still rare (<1%), and females are more appropriately categorized as ‘other 
cattle’. Therefore all cattle of Mongolia are taken as other cattle. Broiler chickens are 
typically grown approximately 60 days before slaughter. In order to avoid overestimation, 
annual average population of poultry is estimated according to equation 10.1 (IPCC 2006) 
and estimated numbers are entered in the Table 5-1.

(2) The EF values are specified by livestock category and regional grouping in the IPCC 
2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 10, Tables 10.10 and 10.11. The EF listed under Asia region are chosen for 
the Mongolia (Table 5-11). 

The dimensionless conversion factors used are:

- 10-6, to convert the emissions from kg CH4 to Gg CH4; and

- GWP-CH4 = 21 (100-year time horizon global warming potential provided by the 
IPCC in its Second Assessment Report), to convert Gg CH4 to Gg CO2e (17/CP.8, 
Annex, paragraph 20).

5.2.2 Manure management (CRF 3.A.2)

5.2.2.1 Source category description

The GHG emissions from manure management consists of methane (CH4) and nitrous 
oxide (N2O) gases from aerobic and anaerobic manure decomposition processes. The 
term ‘manure’ is used here collectively and includes both dung and urine produced by 
livestock. The emissions level depends on the amount of manure treated and handled 
within manure management systems and type of manure management systems. 

The main manure management systems covered by this inventory were: pasture/range/
paddock for the cattle, sheep, goats, horses and camels, and daily spread system for the 
swine and poultry. For this case, N2O emissions during storage and treatment of these two 
systems are assumed to be zero and N2O emissions from land application of Mongolian 
livestock are covered under the Aggregated sources and non-CO2 emissions sources on 
land (CRF 3.C) source category. Only CH4 is reported under the source category manure 
management (CRF 3.A.2). 

5.2.2.2 Summary of emission trends

The total emissions attributed to manure management was 251.22 Gg CO2e making 
up 3% of the total livestock emissions in 2014. This was 43.36% and 15.00% above 1990 
and 2013 levels respectively (Table 5-13). Main driver of the emission fluctuation of the 
manure management between 1990 and 2014 is loss of livestock population during 
natural disasters (See in overview of the Agricultural sector). The Figure 5-6 shows that 
total methane emissions from manure management by livestock type.

CHAPTER 5

Agriculture (CRF 3)

Figure 5-6: Total emission trend from manure management of livestock

In 1990, cattle contributed 34% of the total emissions from manure management (Figure 
5-7). The rest were as follows: sheep (18%), horses (30%), camels (8%), goats (7%), swine 
(3%) and poultry (0.006%). By 2014, percentage share of the each livestock contribution 
to the manure management is changed as follows: cattle (29%), sheep (19%), horses 
(27%), camels (4%), goats (20%) swine (1%) and poultry (0.011%).

Figure 5-7: Each livestock contribution to the manure management emission in 
1990 and 2014

Over the period under review, emission trend from each livestock category showed 
different patterns of change comparing with the base year. By 2014, the percentage of 
such categories as camel and swine decreased compared to 1990 year level, while the 
percentage of other categories such as cattle, sheep, goats, horses and poultry increased 
(Table 5-12).

5.2.2.3 Activity Data, Methodological Issues and Emission Factors

Emissions from manure management were calculated at Tier 1, following IPCC 2006 Vol. 
4, Ch. 10 methodology according to the formula:

Emission = A * EF

Where:

Emission = GHG emissions, in kg CH4 yr-1;

A = Activity data, representing the number of livestock in heads (1);

EF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in units of kg CH4 head-1 yr-1 (2).

(1) Activity data cover the following animal categories: cattle, horses, camels, sheep, goats, 
swine and poultry. For the period between 1990 and 2014, the activity data are taken from 
Statistical yearbooks of agriculture 1990-2014. For dairy cattle, in Mongolia, specialized 
dairy breeds are still rare (<1%), and females are more appropriately categorized as ‘other

cattle’. Therefore, all cattle of Mongolia are taken as other cattle. Broiler chickens are 
typically grown approximately 60 days before slaughter. In order to avoid overestimation, 
annual average population of poultry is estimated according to equation 10.1 (IPCC 2006) 
and estimated numbers are entered in the Table 5-1.

(2) The EF values are specified by livestock category and regional grouping in the IPCC 
2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 10, Tables 10A-5 and 10A-9. The EF listed under Asia region and average 
annual temperature (<10) are chosen for the Mongolia (Table 5-13). The share of the 
individual animal manure management systems common in Mongolia were estimated 
by expert judgment and categorized by animal type. 

The dimensionless conversion factors used are:

- 10-6, to convert the emissions from kg CH4 to Gg CH4; and

- GWP-CH4 = 21 (100-year time horizon global warming potential provided by the 
IPCC in its Second Assessment Report), to convert Gg CH4 to Gg CO2e (17/CP.8, 
Annex, paragraph 20).

5.3 Aggregated sources and non-CO2 emission sources from land (CRF 3.C)

Emissions under this category, CH4 and N2O from biomass burning, direct and indirect N2O 
from managed soils, are reported in this inventory. In 2014, the total GHG emissions from 
this source category were 6,886.94 Gg CO2e representing 41.17% of the total emissions 
of agriculture sector. 

In general, the total 3C sector emissions showed an increasing trend from 4,099.40 Gg 
CO2e in 1990 to 6,886.94 Gg CO2e in 2014. The observed growing level of emissions was 
mainly due to rising animal populations which directly increased the amount of manure 
deposited on the pasture. However, there were two times sharp decrease of the livestock

number in 1999-2002 and 2009-2010 due to high number of livestock loss during the 
cold disaster event during the winter season named dzud explained in the overview of 
the agricultural sector section. Thus N2O emissions from managed soils in these years 
declined and gradually increased back in next following years (see Figure 5-2 and Table 
5-14). The percentage of the trend change of the aggregated sources and non-CO2 
emission sources category emissions by source categories is given in the Table 5-14.

5.3.1 Biomass burning (CRF 3.C.1)

5.3.1.1 Source category description

Both uncontrolled (wildfires) and managed (prescribed) fires can have a major impact on 
the non-CO2 emission from forests. Under this category, burning of biomass consists of 
CH4, N2O, NOx and CO from biomass combustion of forest land is estimated. 

5.3.1.2 Summary of emission trends

The total emissions attributed to biomass burning was 2.58 Gg CO2e making up 0.02 % of 
the total aggregated sources and non-CO2 emission sources on land emissions in 2014. 
This was -97.58% below and 236.91% above 1990 and 2013 levels respectively (Table 
5-15). Main driver of the emission fluctuation is forest fire occurrences of certain years 
(Figure 5-9).

5.3.1.3 Activity data, methodological issues and emission factors

The emissions from burning of biomass combustion of forest land were estimated using 
the Tier 1 method of IPCC 2006 according to the following formula: 

Emission = A * MB * Cf *EF

Where:

- Emission = GHG emissions in Gg CH4, Gg N2O, Gg NOx and Gg CO.

- A = Activity data, representing the total mass of fuel burned, in kg of dry matter. AD 
(area burnt) is taken from FAOSTAT Emissions database, in the Emissions-Land Use/
Burning-Biomass domain from 1990 to 2014. Obtained data from FAOSTAT were 
based on official data between 1996 and 2014 and calculated data between 1990 
and 1995. 

- MB = the mass of fuel (MB) available for combustion, in tons/ha, which includes 
biomass, litter and dead wood.

- Cf = combustion factor 

- EF = Tier 1 IPCC emission factor, expressed in g CH4, g N2O or g CO2, per kg of 
burned dry matter (IPCC 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 2, Table 2.4-2.6).

5.3.2 Direct N2O emissions from managed soils (CRF 3.C.4)

5.3.2.1 Source category description

In most soils, an increase in available N enhances nitrification and denitrification rates 
which then increase the production of N2O. Increase in available N can occur through 
human-induced N additions or change of land-use and/or management practices that 
mineralize soil organic N.

The following N sources included for estimating direct N2O emissions from managed 
soils in this report are: synthetic N fertilizers (FSN); organic N applied as fertilizer (animal 
manure) (FON); urine and dung N deposited on pasture, range and paddock by grazing 
animals (FPRP); and N in crop residues (FCR).

5.3.2.2 Summary of emission trends

The total emissions attributed to direct N2O emissions from managed soils was 5,037.18 
Gg CO2e making up 73.16% of the total aggregated sources and non-CO2 emission 
sources on land emissions in 2014. This was 69.34% and 14.40% above 1990 and 2013 
levels respectively (Table 5-16). Main driver of the emission fluctuation of the direct N2O

In 1990, urine and dung N deposited on pasture, range and paddock by grazing animals 
contributed 97.07% of the total emissions from direct N2O. The rest were as follows: 
inorganic N fertilizer application (1.49%), organic N applied as fertilizer (0.05%) and N in 
crop residues (1.38%). By 2014, the percentage share of each source contribution to 
the direct N2O emissions from managed soils is changed as follows: urine and dung 
N deposited on pasture, range and paddock by grazing animals (97.72%), inorganic N 
fertilizer application (1.79%), organic N applied as fertilizer (0.01%), and N in crop residues 
(0.48%). The results are shown in the Figure 5-10 and Figure 5-11.

5.3.2.3 Activity data, methodological Issues and emission factors

Emissions from direct N2O emissions from managed soils were calculated at Tier 1, 
following IPCC 2006 Vol. 4, Ch. 10 and 11 methodologies according to the formula:

N2O direct = N2O (SN) + N2O (ON) + N2O (PRP) + N2O (CR) 

Where:

- N2O (SN) – annual N2O emissions from the amount of synthetic fertilizer N applied to 
soils; Gg/yr;

- N2O (ON) – annual N2O emissions from the amount of animal manure, compost, 
sewage sludge and other organic N additions applied to soils, Gg/yr;

- N2O (PRP) – annual N2O emissions from urine and dung inputs to grazed soils, Gg/yr; 

- N2O (CR) – annual N2O emissions from the amount of N in crop residues (above-
ground and below-ground), including N-fixing crops and from forages during 
pasture renewal, returned to soils, Gg/yr; 

Summary of activity data and emission factor used to obtain the N2O(SN); N2O(ON); N2O(PRP); 
N2O(CR) is included in Table 5-17.

5.3.3 Indirect N2O emissions from managed soils (CRF 3.C.5)

5.3.3.1 Source category description

In addition to the direct emissions of N2O from managed soils that occur through a direct 
pathway (i.e., directly from the soils to which N is applied), emissions of N2O also take 
place through two indirect pathways. The first of these pathways is the volatilization of 
N as NH3 and oxides of N (NOx), and the deposition of these gases and their products 
NH4+ and NO3- onto soils and the surface of lakes and other waters. The second pathway 
is the leaching and runoff from land of N from synthetic and organic fertilizer additions, 
crop residues, mineralization of N associated with loss of soil C in mineral and drained/
managed organic soils through land-use change or management practices, and urine 
and dung deposition from grazing animals. 

The following N sources included for estimating indirect N2O emissions from managed 
soils in this report are: synthetic N fertilizers (FSN); organic N applied as fertilizer (animal 
manure) (FON); urine and dung N deposited on pasture, range and paddock by grazing 
animals (FPRP); and N in crop residues (FCR) and results are summarized as volatilization and 
leaching/runoff pathways in the Table 5-18.

5.3.3.3 Activity data, methodological issues and emission factors

Emissions from indirect N2O emissions from managed soils were calculated using Tier 1 
method of IPCC 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 10 and 11 methodologies according to the formula:

N2O indirect = N2O (ATD) + N2O (L)

Where:

- N2O (ATD) – indirect N2O emissions, produced from atmospheric deposition of 
nitrogen as ammonia (NH3), oxides of N (NOx), and their products NH4+ and NH3- 
onto soils and the surface of lakes and other waters; deposition of agriculturally 
derived NH3 and NOx, following the application of synthetic and organic N fertilizers 
and/or urine and dung deposition from grazing animals;

- N2O (L) – from leaching and runoff from land of N from synthetic and organic 
fertilizer additions, crop residues returned to soils, mineralization of N associated 
with loss of soil C in mineral and drained/managed organic soils through land-use 
change or management practices and urine and dung deposition from grazing 
animals.

Summary of activity data and emission factor used to obtain the N2O(SN); N2O(ON); N2O(PRP); 
N2O (CR) to include above formula is included in Table 5-19.

6.1 Overview of the sector 

In the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006), 
the AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use) category combines two previously distinct 
sectors LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry) and agriculture defined in 
the 1996 Revised IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (revised IPCC 
1996). The structure of 6 land use categories under LULUCF was retained. Although, 
only Forest land remaining forest land (CRF 3.B.1) of Land category and Harvested wood 
products (CRF 3.D.1) of Other (CRF 3.D) category are covered under the LULUCF sector 
for this submission (Table 6-1). The emissions and removals from the HWP were less than 
one per cent for all years of the inventory. The changes of trend in percentage between 
1990/2014 and 2013/2014 are given below of the following table.

6.1.2 Methodological Issues

In the LULUCF sector of Mongolia’s 2017 GHG inventory submission, the IPCC 2006 
guidelines have been used. Additionally for the calculation of the harvested wood 
products (HWP) emissions and removals, the Kyoto Protocol (KP) Supplement was used. 
The emissions and removals from Land (CRF 3.B) and Harvested wood products (CRF 
3.D.1) were estimated using the mixture of Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods, and country specific 
and default emission factors (EFs) values. Obtainable country specific activity data for all 
the categories were used. Where country specific activity data were non-existent, data 
from international data source (FAOSTAT) were used. 

A summary description of methods used to estimate emissions by categories is provided 
in Table 6-3, while a more detailed description is available in chapters 6.2-6.3 of the 
National inventory report (NIR).

6.1.3 Uncertainties assessment and time series consistency

There is an uncertainty attached to the estimation of area information for forest land from 
the Administration of Land Affairs, Geodesy and Cartography (ALAGAC). The uncertainties 
for the emission factors (EFs) are noted by the IPCC, whereas the data applied to estimate 
the gains and losses definitely have inherent uncertainties: wood harvest information

CHAPTER 6

Forestry and Other Land Use/LULUCF (CRF 4)

(and the uncertainties attached to the linear extrapolation of the information from 1999 
to 1990), areas of different forest types to weight the emission factor calculations. The 
disturbance numbers are based on international sources, extrapolation and expert 
knowledge. 

Based on IPCC 2013 KP Supplement the uncertainties in FAOSTAT data is given with -25 
/ +5 % for the HWP. The uncertainties for applied emission factors are not given in IPCC 
Table 2.8.2. Thus no overall calculation of uncertainties for HWP estimations is possible.

6.1.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Control

In the current submission all applied information and data have been double-checked 
as far as possible. The application of methods have been proof-read and follows the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006). The activity data 
(AD) and methods used to estimate GHG emissions under this sector was documented 
and archived both in hard and electronic copies. For the next submission, an overall 
quality control and quality assurance system should be in place. This system will describe 
transparently the involved agencies and roles, data flows and calculation methods. 

6.1.5 Source specific recalculations

A recalculation in this category is not done in this submission, due to the implementation 
of a complete new National System for Greenhouse Gas Inventories and thus, the first 
time application of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and incorporation of most recent data 
collection methods (and first time application of their methodological approach). Thus 
compared to earlier versions of the Mongolian GHG inventory, the whole inventory can 
be considered as recalculated.

6.1.6 Assessment of completeness

The current LULUCF inventory covers CO2 emissions and removals from 2 source 
categories: Land (CRF 3.B) and Other (CRF 3.D) from 1990 to 2014. The Land category 
estimation based only on Forest land remaining forest land (CRF 3.B.1.a) source category 
whilst other (CRF 3.D) category consist Harvested wood products (CRF 3.D.1). 

6.1.7 Source specific planned improvements

In the initial BUR of Mongolia (iBUR), it was decided to estimate only biomass of gain and 
losses on the forest land remaining forest land category, including HWP for the LULUCF 
sector without land use change (LUC) calculation (Table 6-1). Thus, the removals are may 
be overestimated or underestimated and further improvements will be needed and to 
be addressed in further national inventory. There is on-going project to improve the land 
use assessment using Collect Earth tool at the Climate Change Project Implementing 
Unit (CCPIU, main compiler unit of GHGI) with support of the UNREDD Mongolia National 
Program. Current assessment plots are covered all over the Mongolian territory with 
circa 120,000 grid-plots and aiming to evaluate land use, land use change from 1990 to 
2015/2016. The six main land categories of the Collect Earth assessment align with IPCC 
categories.

6.2 Land (CRF 3.B)

GHG emissions from the Land use, Land use change and Forestry sector consists 
largely of carbon dioxide gas, generated mainly through cropland, grassland and forest 
management activities, including carbon gain and losses linked to anthropogenic land 
use changes. According to the IPCC methodology, estimation on this sector should 
consider all six land categories: forest land, cropland, grassland, wetland, settlement 
and other land. Due to the some limitations regarding activity data generation and time 
series consistency, only forest land remaining forest land category is reported for this 
submission. The Figure 6-1 shows that 24 years’ trend of CO2 removal in Mongolia. 

Figure 6-1: GHG removal trend in Land source category for the period 1990-2014, Gg CO2e

The forest resources which cover about 10% of the country and are split in Mongolia: 
in the north the more boreal type of forest is found whilst in the southern regions the 
predominant forest type is Saxaul. The question of definition of forest is controversial in 



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 6

Forestry and Other Land Use/LULUCF (CRF 4)

Mongolia and thus, under constant debate. The different agencies and institutions rely 
on different attributes of their forest definitions for several purposes. Nevertheless, there 
is a vital discussion on-going in Mongolia about the necessity of one or more definitions 
of forest land and woody biomass ecosystems in general. This might also influence the 
reporting in the successional submissions of the NIR. In the GHG inventory sense, the 
IPCC definition of Forest land was applied: This category includes all land with woody 
vegetation consistent with thresholds used to define Forest Land in the national greenhouse 
gas inventory. It also includes systems with a vegetation structure that currently fall below, but 
in situ could potentially reach the threshold values used by a country to define the Forest Land 
category.

For the consistent representation of lands, their utilization throughout the time series, 
available data from the Administration of Land Affairs, Geodesy and Cartography (ALAGAC) 
have been applied. The national land use classification consists of a 3 level hierarchical 
stratification, starting from the country total (level 0) to broad land use classes (level 1: 
Agricultural Land; Settlements; Road, Line and Network; Land with Forest Resource; Land 
with Water Resources; Land for Special Utilization) and even more detailed land use sub-
classes (level 2). Particular is the class “Land for Special Utilization” since its level 2 strata 
can be further divided in the level 1 classes of the land use classes other than “Land for 
Special Utilization”. Thus, it represents a subset of the respective land use class, but with 
another function, defined by ALAGAC. This spilt is important for domestic reporting but 
not for the areas’ potential in sequestering and emitting GHGs, therefore, we re-allocated 
the areas under “special utilization” to the relevant land-use classes without the restriction 
of special use.

The aggregation of the ALAGAC land use classification into the applied seven sub-classes 
is based on the definitions available from ALAGAC plus expert knowledge (Table 6-5).

Especially when it comes to forest area further clarification, consolidation and country-
wide harmonization has to be done: The forest in Mongolia consists of two mayor types 
of forest:

1. Boreal conifer forests in the north and

2. Saxaul forest in the south of the country.

The forest area for the boreal forests, their coverage and characteristics are assessed in a 
national forest inventory (NFI) whilst more detailed information on Saxaul forests remain 
sparse. For that reason in this submission the definitions for forest is applied following 
the ALAGAC land classification. Nevertheless, it is planned to incorporate new area 
information on both forest types (and thus the remaining land-use classes) as soon as 
they are available. 

The area aggregation of the ALAGAC land use data into the applied IPCC six land classes 
is shown in the Table 6-6.

Since ALAGAC area data only gives a broad forest class with no separation in the two 
forest types, a general split of 75% boreal to 25% Saxaul forest was applied based on 
recent report (Report on Forest, 2014 approved by Ministry of Environment and Tourism) 
and expert knowledge. Figure 6-2 shows that total forest area of Mongolia based on 
National Land Agency (ALAGAC) data. 

Figure 6-2: Total forest area by two sub-categories 

The IPCC 2006 methodology was followed to estimate the gains and losses. The emission 
factors like below-ground carbon and expansion factors (BECFs), carbon fractions, above-
ground biomass and below-ground biomass ratio (AGB-BGB-ratios) are taken from the 
IPCC tables (IPCC 2006, Table 4.4) and national information like on growth and stocks (The 
Multipurpose National Forest Inventory of Mongolia, 2016). The main factors used for the 
forest land GHG estimation are shown in Table 6-7.

The activity data of wood harvest collected from the National Statistical Information 
Database (http://1212.mn). Information on harvested wood is available from 1999 to 
date. Despite the fact that data is available on provincial-disaggregation level, nation-
wide data was used. It is assumed that fuel wood is only collected in whole tree form, 
thus the same methodology is applied as for the harvest removals. Further, it is assumed 
that wood harvest and fuel wood collection only happens on Forest Land Remaining 
Forest Land.

The information of disturbance consolidated the NFI which found 18.60% of the forested 
area (11.3 million ha) was burned. That results in 2,101,800 ha. Further, it assumed that the 
forest effect can be detected in the NFI for about 10 years. Thus, the assumption taken 
was 2,101,800 ha divided by 10 years equals 210,180 ha / year. Based on this assumption, 
disturbed area is taken as 200,000 ha every year in the Forest land estimation. 

6.3 Other (CRF 3.D) - Harvested Wood Products (CRF 3.D.1)

Much of the wood that is harvested from Forest Land, Cropland and other types of land 
use remain in products for differing lengths of time. Harvested Wood Product (HWP) 
constitutes a carbon reservoir. The time carbon is held in products will vary depending 
on the product and its uses (IPCC 2006, Vol. 4, p12.5).

For the HWP UN FAO’s FAOSTAT database have been applied. The category is a bit different 
from the land use categories since the data source is rather clear and well described by 
for example FAOSTAT. The emissions and removals trend from the HWP category is given 
in Table 6-1 and Figure 6-3.

CHAPTER 6

Figure 6-3: Emission trend of Harvested Wood Products

6.4 Activity data, methodological issues and emission factors

The estimation of harvested wood products’ (HWP) contribution to the LULUCF as part of 
the GHG inventory in Mongolia is based on IPCC 2006 and IPCC 2013 KP Supplement as 
far as methodological choices and emission factor selection are concerned. Activity data 
stem from UN FAO’s FAOSTAT database. What becomes obvious in the data source is a 
possible linear interpolation introduced by FAOSTAT between 1995 and 2010.

The activity data applied consists of the 1961-2014 time series information that is 
available for the imports, exports and domestic production quantities for paper and 
paperboard, sawnwood, and wood-based panels (as defined in http://www.fao.org/
forestry/statistics/80572/en/)1 . To prevent double-counting, the following statement is 
considered:

HWP in SWDS and wood harvested for energy are thus, implicitly treated on the basis of 
instantaneous oxidation (i.e. reporting no net - emissions from HWP). Estimates that are based 
on the three default commodities [annotation: as mentioned above] are by definition not 
derived from wood harvested for energy purposes (p. 2.119 IPCC 2013 KP Supplement).

For this submission the starting year of accumulation is set to i = 1961, since activity data 
are available since this year. An extrapolation until the recommended starting year of i = 
1900 is mentioned as a possible improvement.

Since aggregated values of the three default commodities (mentioned above) have been 
obtained from the FAOSTAT database, conversion factors are used in an aggregated way. 
For this submission no country specific values for the disaggregation of sub-commodities,

7.1 Overview of the sector 

This Chapter includes information on the GHG emissions from the waste sector. The 
categories and activities for estimation of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) 
emissions are described in detail. The GHG inventory of the waste sector is based on 
the estimating of methane from solid waste disposal sites, methane emissions from 
wastewater treatment and discharge, and nitrous oxide from human sewage.

The approaches and emission factors employed in estimations of GHG emissions from 
source categories of the waste sector are presented in Table 7-1. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006) default values are applied in 
calculations. The selection of methods followed the decision trees in IPCC 2006.

As seen from the Figure 7-2 and Table 7-2 CH4 and N2O emissions from SWDS and 
domestic wastewater treatment and discharge have increased continuously year after 
year in relation to the population increase especially in urban areas. CH4 emission has 
rapidly increased for the last five years due to waste disposed into well-managed landfills 
which are covered with soil since 2010, in Ulaanbaatar. Meanwhile, the emission trend of 
methane from industrial wastewater treatment and discharge was fluctuating due to the 
certain year’s economic condition. 

7.1.1 Key categories

There is no key category in the waste sector in the national level key category analysis 
(KCA). The total emissions from this sector are the insignificant, contributing to only 0.46% 
of the national total. The SWDS and domestic wastewater treatment and discharge are 
major sources for emissions in 2014 under the waste sector. 

7.1.2 Uncertainties and time series consistency 

The uncertainty estimate of the 2014 inventory has been done according to the Tier 1 
method proposed by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
(IPCC 2006). 

All calculated uncertainties of emission factors and activity data used are in accordance 
with the methodology used in emission estimations, derived from IPCC 2006 and 
detailed uncertainty values used in uncertainty assessment are presented under source 
of categories descriptions below.

The estimated uncertainties for total greenhouse gas emissions in 2014 in waste sector 
presented in the Table 7-4.

uncertainty is high due to assessment of insufficient data and applied default emission 
factors. Investigation will be performed with a view to collect more accurate data. All 
categories comprised in uncertainty estimates can be seen in Annex III. The time series 
was checked for the consistency.

7.1.3 Source specific QA/QC and verification

General quality control (QC) procedures were applied in the waste sector according to 
the IPCC 2006 (Vol 1, Chapter 6, Table 6.1):

- Documentation on activity data and emission factors have been cross-checked 
with the corresponding data in the calculation model. 

- Units and conversion factors were checked. 

- The GHG emissions were estimated using the 2006 IPCC software and compared 
to the emissions calculated on the excel sheets as well. As a result of this, quality 
control typing errors were identified and corrected. 

- Completeness and consistency of emission estimates and on the proper use of 
notation keys in the common reporting format (CRF) tables were checked.

- Every annual inventory were archived both in hard and electronic copies.

7.1.4 Source specific recalculations

The previous GHG inventory estimations have been conducted in accordance with 
revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (revised IPCC 
1996). Recalculations were made according to applied IPCC 2006, all emission sources 
have been recalculated accordingly.

Abbreviations: SNC – Second National Communication; iBUR – First Biennial Update Report

As seen from Table 7-5, in comparison with the performed recalculation quantities of 
emitted methane from waste sectors in the BUR are lower than the results included into 
Mongolia’s Second National Communication (SNC) under the UNFCCC, due to updating 
activity data and emission factors according to new methodology.

7.1.5 Source specific planned improvements

All activity data and parameters of waste sector for the emissions estimations will be kept 
under investigation and updated when data will be available, and will consider using 
them in the calculation of the emissions. 

7.2 Solid waste disposal 

7.2.1 Source specific description

The CH4 emissions from solid waste disposal sites (SWDS) cover managed and un-
managed waste disposal sites. Emissions from both disposal sites are estimated by using 
the first order decay (FOD) method from the year 1970. 

Total emissions from the SWDS have increased by 71.06 Gg CO2e (463.35%) from the 1990 
level of 15.33 Gg CO2e. CH4 emissions from SWDS are presented in Figure 7-3.

Figure 7-3: Quantities of CH4 emission from biodegradable solid waste disposed in landfills 
1990–2014, Gg

As seen from the Figure 7-3, the quantities of emitted methane from solid waste disposal 
(SWD) is at an increasing trend, and it depends on the population growth, especially 
in urban areas. Methane emissions have rapidly increased for the last five years, due 
to waste disposed to well-managed landfills which are covered with soil since 2010, in 



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 7

Waste (CRF 5)

Ulaanbaatar. Another main factor which affected the increase of emission estimation is 
application of the FOD method for the SWD source category in first time. 

7.2.2 Methodological issues

7.2.2.1 CH4 emissions

The method used to calculate CH4 emissions according to 2006 IPCC Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006) by using the FOD method. Emissions 
from MSW disposal consist of domestic and commercial sources. The emissions were 
estimated taking account of population, per capita waste generation, and quantity 
collected and deposited of waste disposal sites. 

The quantity of CH4 emitted during decomposition process is directly proportional to the 
fraction of degradable organic carbon (DOC), which is defined as the carbon content of 
different types of organic biodegradable wastes such as papers and textiles, garden and 
park waste, food waste, wood and straw waste.

7.2.2.2 Activity data and methane correction factor

Incomplete data for municipal solid waste (MSW) in Mongolia makes it difficult to 
accurately determine GHG emissions from the waste sector. The amount of generation of 
waste is available only from Ulaanbaatar city. The exact amounts of MSW generated from 
other urban and rural areas of Mongolia are not available. Therefore, the amounts of MSW 
from the urban areas were calculated by multiplying per capita waste generation rates 
with the number of urban population. Data on urban population was obtained from the 
dataset of the NSO.

The generation rates were assumed as the follows and it can be divided into three periods:

- 1970-1999: 0.334 kg/cap/day1,

- 2000-2009: 0.6 kg/cap/day2,

- 2010-2014: 0.84 kg/cap/day3

The fraction of the MSW disposed to SWDS is assumed as 65% by local experts 
(Namkhainyam B. et al. “Studies on country specific GHG emission and removal factors for 
Mongolia, 2014”). The assumption was used for the whole inventory period. Additionally, 
the amount of waste generation from Ulaanbaatar city is used for verification of the 
estimated MSW balance.

The amount of waste disposed at SWDS is derived from the dataset of the Ulaanbaatar 
City Mayor’s Office. In 2006, a Project “The Study on Solid Waste Management Plan for 
Ulaanbaatar City in Mongolia by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) was 
developed. 

Based on this study, MSW waste includes waste from household and streets and public 
spaces that account for approximately 55% of the solid waste disposal sites. 

The Figure 7-4 shows the comparison of MSW disposed to SWDS.

CHAPTER 7

Waste (CRF 5)

Figure 7-4: Amount of MSW disposed to SWDS in Ulaanbaatar city

As seen from the Figure 7-4, the observed MSW in the last 5 years was bigger than 
estimated amount due to illegal disposed wastes that were collected in Ulaanbaatar 
city. The waste composition is probably the most important factor affecting landfill gas 
generation rates and quantities. The amount of landfill gas produced is dependent on 
the amount of organic matter landfilled. 

The country specific data of waste composition were taken from the research report from 
Namkhainyam B. et al. “Studies on country specific GHG emission and removal factors for 
Mongolia, 2014”. The composition of waste is presented in the Figure 7-5, which was used 
for the entire period of 1990 – 2014.

Figure 7-5: Composition of waste

In 2014, Mongolia’s total urban population was 1,990,320 and 2/3 of the total urban 
population lives in Ulaanbaatar city. Therefore, it was assumed that approximately 2/3 of 
the total waste is generated only from Ulaanbaatar city. There are 3 operational controlled 
landfill sites in Ulaanbaatar city. In Mongolia’s case, the first regulated municipal solid 
waste disposal site, namely Moringiin davaa which started its operation in 1970. Thus,

to estimate the CH4 emissions from SWDS by using the FOD method, the time series for 
disposed waste amounts were developed from the 1970s (detailed in Table 7-6).

All solid waste disposal sites in Mongolia, in particular in the Ulaanbaatar city, were un-
managed before 2009 using mainly up to 5 meters of soil cover. Landfill technology 
started to get used at the operational SWDSs of Ulaanbaatar city from the end of 2009 
and 8-10 ha areas are processing annually on these sites. Thus, calculations made under 
solid waste disposal comprise of managed as well as un-managed disposal sites. The solid 
waste disposal sites in Mongolia fall into the un-managed shallow type according to IPCC 
guidelines before 2009 and then divided un-managed and managed type from 2010. 
Based on this national circumstance, the methane correction factor (MCF) was chosen 
differently for the inventory period. MCF of 0.4 is taken as a default value for emission 
estimation between 1970 and 2009. Then in the later period of the inventory (2010-2014), 
MCF of 1.0 is applied for the managed landfill sites and 0.4 (default value) for un-managed 
sites for the emission estimation. The MCFs were used for calculation are presented in the 
Table 7-7.

- total MSW generation due to revision of waste generation rates per capita

- composition of waste 

- fraction of MSW sent to SWDS

- methods of disposals and their various percentages.

7.2.6 Source specific planned improvements

As reported above there is still a lack of activity data. Thus for the improvement of 
emissions estimates are:

- update the historical data on waste generation per capita 

- refine the distribution of waste by waste management type.

7.3.2.2 Methodological issues 

CH4 Emissions

The methane emissions from industrial wastewater have been calculated using the IPCC 
Tier 1 methodology proposed by IPCC 2006. 

In 2015, approximately 25.19% of households were connected to centralized aerobic 
wastewater treatment plants. 47.58% of households use latrines, 26.8% of households 
lack wastewater disposal points and only 0.42% use septic tanks.

Wastewater treatment and discharge systems usage differ for rural and urban residents. 
Hence, a factor U is introduced to express each income group fraction. It is a good practice 
to treat the three categories: rural population, urban-high income population, and urban-
low income population separately.

Mongolia administratively is divided into the capital Ulaanbaatar, 21 provinces called 
aimag, and aimags into soums. Therefore, population of Ulaanbaatar city was considered 
as an urban high income group, population of 21 provinces as urban low income group 
and population of soums as rural group. 

Number of inhabitants included into various types of domestic wastewater treatment 
presented in Table 7-12. 

Before 2015, unavailable research for degrees of treatment utilization (T) for each income 
group (U). Thus for emission calculations were used as the result of research in 2015 (see 
Table 7-13).

For domestic wastewater, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is the recommended 
parameter used to measure the degradable organic component of the wastewater. 
The BOD concentration indicates only the amount of carbon that is aerobically 
biodegradable. According to the Mongolian standard the BOD value4 is 40g/cap/day 
(14600 kg/1000persons/yr). The IPCC default as well as national standards value of 40g 
BOD/person/day or 14600 kg BOD/1000 person/year was used for emission calculations. 

The IPCC default values of correction factor for additional industrial BOD discharged into 
sewers were used for emission calculations. The BOD from industries assumed that are 
co-discharged with domestic wastewater in urban high and low income group by expert 
judgment, therefore was chosen default values as 1.25 for urban high and low income 
group, 1 for rural area for emission calculations.

The methane producing potential (B0) is the maximum amount of CH4 that can be 
produced from a given quantity of organics (as expressed in BOD) in the wastewater. The 
CH4 producing potential varies according to the composition of the wastewater and its 
degradability. The IPCC default of 0.6 kg CH4/kg BOD was used for emission calculations.

CHAPTER 7

Waste (CRF 5)

The Ulaanbaatar Water Supply and Sewerage Company (USUG) manage the centralized 
system that serves the apartment area and a very small proportion of the ger areas. 
The main water treatment plant is the central wastewater treatment plant which has a 
capacity of 170,000 m3 per day. The volume of wastewater now far exceeds the physical 
and technical capacity of these plants which have obsolete technical equipment dating 
from the socialist era. As a result 170,000 to 190,000m3 of improperly treated wastewater is 
discharged into the Tuul River daily5. As reported above, 2/3 of the total urban population 
lives in Ulaanbaatar. Therefore, methane correction factor for centralized aerobic treatment 
plant default IPCC value of 0.3 was used for emission calculations.

Methane conversion factors (MCFs) were applied depending on the treatment type 
and level. The IPCC default values were used as a source of MCF value. However, expert 
judgment was performed to choose values applicable for Mongolian conditions (Table 
7-14).

In the case of Mongolian, even in the capital city and other main cities, wastewater 
treatment facilities do not have an operational device for the methane recovery or gas 
combustion in as flare for energy. Originally, at the centralized aerobic treatment plants 
of big cities including Ulaanbaatar city has installed methane recovery devices and those 
are never used due to the lack of human capacity and later all of them became out of 
use6. 

Therefore, for amount of methane recovered default IPCC value of zero was used for 
emission calculations.

N2O Emissions

The N2O emissions from industrial wastewater have been calculated using the IPCC Tier 
1 methodology proposed by IPCC 2006, due to unavailable country specific parameters. 

N2O emissions from wastewater domestic sources for the period 1990-2014 are shown 
in Figure 7-9. The total amount of N2O emission from domestic wastewater treatment 
in 2014 was 0.07 Gg. This represented a 69.71% increase from 1990 and 8.14% increase 
from 2013.

CHAPTER 7

Waste (CRF 5)

As seen from the Figure 7-4, the quantities of emitted nitrous oxide from domestic 
wastewater sources is at an increasing trend which depends on the population increase 
especially in urban areas. Minor fluctuation in time series is related to the changes per 
capita protein consumption values. Due to a very high global warming potential of N2O, 
relatively low amounts of N2O formation can substantially contribute to GHG emissions.

Referring to the second IPCC assessment report (SAR), 1g N2O has the greenhouse effect 
of 310 g CO2.

Figure 7-8: N2O emissions from wastewater domestic sources

7.3.2.3 Activity data and emission factors 

Annual number of country population has been obtained from NSO. Approximately 
25.19% of the population was connected to centralized aerobic wastewater treatment 
plants. 

The average consumption of protein per inhabitant in every individual year has been 
obtained from the nutrition statistics of NSO. The consumption data has not been 
available for the years of 1990 and 1991, average value for the years of 1992-1994 have 
been applied for the years, where data are missing. Data on population and annual 
protein intake are presented in Table 7-15.

7.3.3.1 Description

The GHG emissions from the Industrial wastewater treatment and discharge have 
increased by 7.57 Gg CO2e (89.48%) from the 1990 level of 8.46 Gg CO2e. The total CO2 
eq. emissions from waste sector in 2014 decreased by 1.84% compared to 2013, due to a 
decrease in alcohol production. CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater treatment for 
the period of 1990-2014 are shown in Figure 3.5-10.

Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 7

Waste (CRF 5)

Fluctuations in aggregated methane emissions from industrial wastewater treatment 
and discharge could be explained with changes of economic situation. Meanwhile, some 
industry sectors were almost closed in the middle of the 90s. Since 2012, emissions have 
been reduced due to closure of some light industries (Figure 7-9).

7.3.3.2 Methodological issues 

CH4 Emissions

The CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater have been calculated using the IPCC Tier 
1 methodology proposed by IPCC 2006. Assessment of CH4 production potential from 
industrial wastewater streams is based on the concentration of degradable organic matter 
in the wastewater is the chemical oxygen demand (COD), the volume of wastewater, 
industrial sectors and ways of wastewater treatment. Data on industrial output for 
industries with the largest potential for wastewater methane emissions identified as 
follows:

- meat processing (slaughterhouse)

- alcohol production

- beer production

- dairy products 

- wine production

- vegetable oil production.

Data on industrial output were taken from dataset of NSO, for the period of 1990-2014. 
The missing data were assessed by interpolation/extrapolation method. Some industrial 
outputs were reported in cubic meters, therefore converted units from cubic meters to 
tons by using the density of alcohol, wine, beer, dairy products were taken as 0.789 kg/l, 
0.9983 kg/l, 1.01 kg/l, 1.028 kg/l respectively. 

The data of degradable organic component and wastewater produced for per ton 
production of those industries as a country specific value were taken from the IPCC 2006 
and other sources. The above values are presented in Table 7-17, which was used for the 
entire period of 1990 – 2014.

The wastewater production was estimated by multiplying the industrial production 
by the wastewater generation coefficients. Total organically degradable material was 
estimated by multiplying the wastewater production by the wastewater generated by 
the COD coefficient of each industrial product.

7.3.4 Source specific uncertainties and time-series consistency 

For the purposes of uncertainty in estimation, emissions from wastewater treatment and 
discharge are divided into the following subgroups: domestic wastewater sources (CH4 
and N2O separately) and industrial wastewater sources (CH4). Uncertainty in the emission 
estimates of wastewater treatment and discharge arises from uncertainties in activity data 
and emission factors. The IPCC recommended default values were used as the source 
for uncertainty values. However, expert judgment was performed to choose values 
applicable for GHG emission calculations from wastewater treatment and discharge are 
presented in Table 7-20. The time series was checked for its consistency.

the IPCC 2006 (Vol 1, Chapter 6, Table 6.1):

- documentation on activity data and emission factors have been cross-checked 
with the corresponding data in the calculation model. 

- units and conversion factors were checked. 

- the GHG emissions were estimated using the 2006 IPCC software and compared 
to the emissions calculated on the excel sheets as well. Results of this comparison 
typing errors were identified and corrected. 

- completeness and consistency of emission estimates and on the proper use of 
notation keys in the CRF tables were checked.

- every annual inventory were archived both in hard copies and electronically.

7.3.6 Source specific recalculations

Recalculations were made due to use of IPCC 2006 all emission sources have been 
recalculated accordingly.

Abbreviations: SNC – Second National Communication; iBUR – First Biennial Update Report

As shown in the Table 7-21, recalculated emission estimations of the methane from 
wastewater treatment and discharge for the iBUR are lower than results included in the 
second national communication (SNC) of Mongolia due to the following updates on 
activity data and some factors:

- changes human population due to revision of population by income groups



Mongolia’s National Inventory Report – 2017

CHAPTER 7

Waste (CRF 5)

- fraction of population income group 

- degrees of treatment utilization/discharge pathway or system for each income 
group due to disaggregation of treatment system

- correction factor for additional industrial BOD discharged into sewers

- industrial production

- wastewater/ unit production

- COD/unit production

N2O emissions from domestic wastewater treatment and discharge for the entire period 
have been calculated using methodology and EFs from IPCC 2006 for the first time in this 
submission.

7.3.7 Source specific planned improvements

All activity data and parameters of wastewater treatment plant and discharge for the 
emissions estimations will be kept under investigation and updated when the data 
becomes available, will be considered to use them in the calculation of the emissions.
