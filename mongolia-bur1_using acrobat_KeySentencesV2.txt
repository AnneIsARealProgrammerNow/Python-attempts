chapter 1

executive summary 

the initial biennial update report of mongolia under the united nations framework 
convention on climate change (unfccc) offers updated information on climate 
change mitigation actions from mongolia’s second national communication submitted 
to the unfccc in 2010. furthermore, it acknowledges mongolia’s efforts to mitigate 
greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions after the submission of the intended nationally 
determined contributions (indc) to unfccc on september 24, 2015. the initial bur has 
the comprehensive information on mitigation scenarios of ghg emissions from 2010 
till 2030 by assessing the key national policy documents in the contexts of sustainable 
development and environment that the government of mongolia has approved.
1.3 financial, technology and capacity needs 

according to decision 2/cp.17, non-annex i parties are to provide updated information 
on constraints and gaps, and related financial, technical and capacity building needs, as 
well as updated information on financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building 
and technical support received from the global environment facility, parties included 
in annex ii to the convention and other developed country parties, the green climate 
fund and multilateral institutions for activities relating to climate change, including for 
the preparation of the current bur.
accordingly, this chapter presents information on the need for continued reporting of the 
ghg inventory under the convention, and financial, technological and capacity building 
needs, constraints and finance received.
further financial, technical and capacity-building needs of mongolia for preparing and 
implementing mitigation projects are listed in nama is given in table 4-1.

mongolia’s national inventory report – 2017

chapter 1

introduction

the preparation of nir is not only meant to serve the purpose of meeting international 
report obligations, but it provides the basis for setting up a national emissions reduction 
targets and mrv system for tracking them in national development policies, sustainable 
institutional arrangement, ghg inventory system and capacity building.
mongolia has just started a project 
with japan through the japan international cooperation agency (jica) on mongolia’s 
ghg inventory system improvement and capacity building.
the duration of the project 
is from the end of 2017 until early 2020. with the implementation of this project, it is 
planned to improve the mongolia’s ghg inventory system, the institutional arrangement 
of ghg inventory, data collection process, capacity building, and all these issues should be 
applied specifically in energy (the energy balance table will be in some part developed) 
and lulucf sectors.
the improvements planned in the following areas: (i) additional activity data 
(ad) collection to improve the completeness; (ii) accuracy and disaggregation of the ad; 
(iii) ad collection system, processing and analysis;(iv) capacity building and institutional 
arrangement.
