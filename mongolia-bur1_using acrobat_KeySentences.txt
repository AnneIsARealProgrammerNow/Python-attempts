mongolia under the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc) offers updated information on climate change mitigation actions from mongolia’s second national communication submitted to the unfccc in 2010. furthermore, it acknowledges mongolia’s efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions after the submission of the intended nationally determined contributions (indc) to unfccc on september 24, 2015. the initial bur has the comprehensive information on mitigation scenarios of ghg emissions from 2010 till 2030 by assessing the key national policy documents in the contexts of sustainable development and environment that the government of mongolia has approved.
to achieve mongolia’s initial biennial update reportnational circumstances and institutional arrangementscontinuous improvement in national reporting, government of mongolia has made institutional arrangements, specific for the nature and scale of the bur preparation.a number of institutions were engaged to conduct various studies for bur, including those that especially carry out studies to identify constraints and gaps and related financial, technical and capacity needs, including information on financial support needed and received.1.3 financial, technology and capacity needs according to decision 2/cp.17, non-annex i parties are to provide updated information on constraints and gaps, and related financial, technical and capacity building needs, as well as updated information on financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building and technical support received from the global environment facility, parties included in annex ii to the convention and other developed country parties, the green climate fund and multilateral institutions for activities relating to climate change, including for the preparation of the current bur.accordingly, this chapter presents information on the need for continued reporting of the ghg inventory under the convention, and financial, technological and capacity building needs, constraints and finance received.
further financial, technical and capacity-building needs of mongolia for preparing and implementing mitigation projects are listed in nama is given in table 4-1. mongolia’s initial biennial update reportchapter 4constraints and gaps, and related financial, technical and capacity needs71table 4-1: financial, technical and capacity building needsactivitiesstatus- ongoing- planned- completedsupport needed (usd)support receivedadditional support neededtechnical and capacity building needsimproved insulation of 300 existing panel apartment buildings in ulaanbaatarplanned90,000,000--planned---planned---financial needstransforming construction in mongolia using supplementary cementitious materialsplanned15,000,000--national energy efficient lighting program in mongoliaplanned7,000,000--installation of 675 mw capacity large hydro power facilitiesplanned1,350,000,000--installation of 354 mw wind power facilitiesplanned584,000,000--installation of 145 mw solar pv power facilitiesplanned573,000,000--technology transfer needsimproved efficiency of coal fired power plants.planned900,000,000--planned---planned---4.1 information on the support received financial support from the global environment facility (gef) towards the preparation of bur was received in december 2015, while as per unfccc decision 2/cp.17 as reported in document number unfccc/cp/2011/9/add.1 clause 44, it should have been received as early as possible in 2012.during 2011-2013, met implemented a project on strengthening carbon financing for regional grassland management in ne asia/2011-2013 with a support of the asian development bank (adb).

(https://www.adb.org/publications/series/asia-least-cost-greenhouse-gas-abatement-strategy-algas) mongolia’s national inventory report – 2017chapter 1introductionthe preparation of nir is not only meant to serve the purpose of meeting international report obligations, but it provides the basis for setting up a national emissions reduction targets and mrv system for tracking them in national development policies, sustainable institutional arrangement, ghg inventory system and capacity building.
mongolia has just started a project with japan through the japan international cooperation agency (jica) on mongolia’s ghg inventory system improvement and capacity building.
the duration of the project is from the end of 2017 until early 2020. with the implementation of this project, it is planned to improve the mongolia’s ghg inventory system, the institutional arrangement of ghg inventory, data collection process, capacity building, and all these issues should be applied specifically in energy (the energy balance table will be in some part developed) and lulucf sectors.
the improvements planned in the following areas: (i) additional activity data (ad) collection to improve the completeness; (ii) accuracy and disaggregation of the ad; (iii) ad collection system, processing and analysis;(iv) capacity building and institutional arrangement.
