National Circumstances Mongolia is the 19thkilometers. It is also the world™s second-largest landlocked country with mountains Mongolia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, as of January 69% (2,096,180) of the total population lives in cities, out of which about 67% (1,396,288) accounts for Ulaanbaatar only. Ulaanbaatar is the capital and the largest city of Mongolia.Mongolia™s economic growth has been based on the production in mining and agricultural to the market economy. of the policy and legal documents related to climate change are listed below:Executive Summary12has outlined a series of policies and measures that the country commits to implement until 2030 in the energy, industry, agriculture and waste sectors. The expected mitigation impact of these policies and measures will have a 14% reduction in the total national GHG emissions excluding Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) by 2030, compared to the projected emissions under a business as usual scenario. Those and other potentially more ambitious commitments are contingent upon gaining access to and instruments under the auspices of the UNFCCC.The energy system is considered to be a major branch of the economy and infrastructure while only 3% by renewable energy sources. Mongolia has an abundance of mineral resources and ranks as one of the world™s leading mining nations. The mining industry plays an important role in the country™s economy, mineral products have consistently accounted for more than 80% of the total export revenues, with copper and coal being the drivers of revenue.Key manufacturing industries are the Cement and Lime industry which are the major contributors to GHG emissions. From 2011 onwards, the Cement and Lime production technology was changed from wet production technology to dry method technology.The construction industry is also closely linked to other parts of the Mongolian economy, took place in the residential segment, which has been the focus of an increasing number transportation sector is of a strategic importance which consists of road, rail, air and water transportation and other sub-sectors. transportation respectively. Mongolian crop-agriculture is primarily rain-fed which is possible in the short raining provides limited potential for agricultural development. Crops produced in Mongolia are wheat, barley, potato and about 30 other types of vegetables. The agriculture sector, therefore, remains heavily focused on livestock husbandry with about 80% of the land allocated to pasture. Only 1% of the land in Mongolia is cultivated with crops, amounting Executive Summary13The livestock-agriculturemeans of utilizing available resources within the severe constraints of climate and limited natural productivity of the region. Livestock production is still the dominant economic activity for the majority of residents. The extensively managed pasture based livestock production system practiced by herders is a viable system that is well adapted to local conditions. Institutional ArrangementsThe Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) of Mongolia is the key ministry to develop, update and implement climate related policies. Thus, the MET is the national entity with the overall responsibility for organizing and coordinating the compilation of National Communications, Biennial updated reports, GHG inventory and submitting them to the the Nature Conservation Fund (name has changed as Environment and Climate Fund since 2017) engaging experienced professionals to facilitate smooth implementation of commitments under UNFCCC. The CCPIU is supervised by National focal point for the UNFCCC. There are three sectoral experts to conduct the GHG inventory. The major data National Greenhouse Gas InventoryThe main sources of GHG emissions have been divided into the following sectors: Energy (CRF 1), Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU, CRF 2), Agriculture (CRF 3), Land use, Total GHG emissions in Mongolia in 2014 were 34,482.73 Gg CO2e (excluding LULUCF). 2increase from the 2013 level with 32,687.27 Gg CO2e. Net GHG emissions in 2014 were 10,030.80 Gg CO2e (including LULUCF). This represented 1,034.44% increase from the 1990 level of -1,073.46 Gg CO2e and 23.23% increase from the 2013 level with 8,139.60 Gg CO2e. In general, emission and removal from each sector increased in 2014 comparing to the values of each GHG inventory sectors.

Two main sources of the total emission were Energy and Agriculture sector for all years of the inventory. However, percentage share of emission sources were varied year by year depending on economic and climatic factors such as demand increase in energy sector and natural disaster occurrence in agriculture sector. To assess overall mitigations actions to identify the future trends, the actions, policies and programs implemented or will be implemented through the national and sectorial policy framework and counter measures are considered. The assessment is based on the The key policies and actions are outlined to assess the future projections and current If the actions described on the national policies and programs are implemented projected emission reduction could be higher. In 2030, GHG emissions in BAU scenario using 2010 as the base year is projected that reduction in waste sector, while removal of follow land decreased by 2.1 times and forest removal potential is expected to increase. In 2030, GHG emissions by gases in BAU scenario using 2010 as the base year is projected that 3.3 times increase of carbon dioxide (CO2), 2.3 times increase of methane (CH4), 2.6 Executive Summary15times increase of Nitrous oxide (N2O). Mongolia put the goal to reduce the GHG emissions by two percent from the current of renewable energy sources and advanced technologies in liquefying and carbonating main approaches to policies and actions to mitigate GHG emissions.

Therefore Mongolia has diverse geographical features such as high mountains, forest steppe, the steppe and the Gobi desert regions. The unique features of these ecosystems are widely recognized in comparison with those of other countries in the same latitude of the northern hemisphere. Geographical features and the dry and cold climate are associated with fragility of natural ecosystems. The nature changeddue to socio-economic stress as well as climate change.Figure 1-1: Location of Mongolia19The Constitution and the 1992 Law on Government Administration proclaims Mongolia as a unitary state with three tiers of local Government. Governance of the administrative and territorial units is based on the principle of centralized authority as well as a gradual transition toward a system of local Governments. The country is divided into 21 administrative units known as ﬁaimagsﬂ. Aimags are further divided in to smaller administrative units ﬁsoumsﬂ, accordingly soums are also divided into smaller groups known as ﬁbagsﬂ which is the lowest administrative unit in the country. Demographyas a whole is famously known as the world™s most sparsely populated nation, with a density of fewer than two people per square kilometer, according to the 2010 census, in aimagcompared to the urban category.

Most of the existing small hydropower plants have been constructed using water diversion channels; the installed capacity is relatively small. As none of these plants can operate in winter due to ice formation, the quoted production values are for the summer months only from May to October. Other two large hydro-dams such as ﬁEgiin gol hydro-damﬂ have not been implemented due to transboundary water debate.Mongolian forest, which covers 8.1% of the territory, is located in the southern border from Khuvsgul Mountains in the north to the Gobi steppe area in the south.22Industry Mongolia has an abundance of mineral resources and ranks as one of the world™s leading mining nations. The mining industry plays an important role in not an only industrial value in 2014. Over the last few years, mineral products have consistently accounted for more than 80% of total export revenues, with copper and coal being the drivers of revenue.Key manufacturing industries are the Cement and Lime industry which are the major contributors to GHG emissions. The Cement and Lime production is shown in Figure 1-4. From 2011 onwards, the Cement and Lime production technology was changed from wet production technology to dry method technology.

As of late 2013, approximately 3,000 km of new roads were either under construction or in the midst of refurbishment, according to extending the national rail system, which at present, consists of only a handful of major cross-country lines. By the end of 2018, the state hopes to have completed projects on 1,800 km of new lines, which will be dedicated, at least initially, to carrying freight.24AgricultureMongolian crop-agriculture is primarily rain-fed which only occurs in the short raining limited potential for agricultural development. Crops produced in Mongolia are wheat, barley, potato and about 30 other types of vegetables. The agriculture sector, therefore, remains heavily focused on livestock husbandry with about 80% of the land allocated to pasture. Only 1% of the land in Mongolia is cultivated with crops, amounting to the of the total land and the yield per hectare (1,647 tons) is almost two times less than the world average (3,886ton). National cereal production meets about 90% and vegetable production meets more than 60% of demand. The agriculture sector engages with 1,190 investment comes from private sectors (MoFALI, 2014).means of utilizing available resources within the severe constraints of climate and limited natural productivity of the region. Livestock production is still the dominant economic activity for the majority of residents. The extensively managed livestock production system as practiced by herders is a viable system, well adapted to local conditions. It also presents both advantages and disadvantages relative to the economic development and conservation of wildlife and natural ecosystems. Animals raised commercially in Mongolia are horses, cattle, goats, sheep and camels. Livestock population is given in Additionally, they are valued for their hair and skin. The livestock subsector accounts for almost 10% of export earnings, approximately 80% of the total agricultural production. About 26% of the work force and about 20% of households, more importantly, over 70% of employments in rural areas are directly engaged in the livestock sector providing food and goods to the remaining 3 million people. Livestock population is increasing from year to year. 251.2 Institutional ArrangementsPreparation of the BURPursuant to the COP decisions on reporting requirements for non-Annex I Parties to the Policy dimensionsof the policy and legal documents related to climate change are listed below:The Environmental Protection Law says that the citizens, economic entities and organizations shall compensate for direct damage caused to the environment and natural resources as a result of their unlawful conduct. The law imposes stricter sanctions against that the subject liable to pay compensation for damage caused to the environment will undergo an assessment by an environmental inspector who will decide the value of the compensation.The renewed Law on Air of Mongolia clearly recognizes the power of the state and local self-governing bodies, the right of citizens, and the organization that is in charge of air quality matters to determine air quality, measure and test, as well as compile relevant data. Also, the law acted the actions to reduce air pollution.The purpose of Law on Forest is to regulate the interrelation of protection, possession, The purpose of the Law on Waste shall be to govern relationships related to the collection, materials to prevent from and eliminate hazardous impact of wastes on public health and environment.26The new was adopted to combat improve land productivity and rehabilitation of land, enable human health and safety life and to set up the liability mechanism.and purposes for green development until 2030, whereas the Mid-term Programme designs policy and strategies to ensure these goals and purposes are implemented.installed capacity generated from renewable sources by 2030. The Renewable Energy new Law on Energy and Renewable energy target is to increase the share of renewable Parliament also approved the Law on Hazardous and Toxic Chemicals (2006), the Law on transportation.The Government has also introduced a number of action plans, including the National Action Programme on Climate Change, the Mongolian Environmental Action Plan, the Action Programme to Protect Air Quality, and the National Action Programme to Protect the Ozone Layer. The National Action Programme on Climate Change (NAPCC) is the most relevant policy document addressing climate change. It was approved by Parliament initially in 2000 and upgraded in 2011 and aimed to meet UNFCCC obligations and commitments, establishing national policy and strategy to tackle the adverse impacts of climate change and to mitigate GHG emissions. The NAPCC is to be implemented in two phases. The setting up the legal environment, structure, institutional and management system, and improving community and public awareness and participation in climate change activities. The second phase (2017-2021) aims to implement climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.Mongolia has joined 14 environment related UN conventions and treaties, including the UNFCCC. Mongolia has submitted two National Communications and now preparing to agree to the Copenhagen Accord, and subsequently Mongolia submitted a list of submitted 22 mitigation options in six sectors towards reducing GHG emissions.27outlined a series of policies and measures that the country commits to implement until 2030, in the energy, industry, agriculture and waste sectors. The expected mitigation impact of these policies and measures will be a 14% (Figure 1-6) reduction in total national GHG emissions excluding land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) by 2030, compared to the projected emissions under a business as usual scenario. Those and other potentially more ambitious commitments are contingent upon gaining access and instruments under the auspices of the UNFCCC.Figure 1-6: Indicative potential emissions reductions of the measures  compared to BAU emissionsInstitutional ArrangementThe Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) of Mongolia is the key ministry to develop, update and implement climate related policies. Thus, the MET is the national entity with the overall responsibility for organizing and coordinating the compilation of National Communications, Biennial updated reports, GHG inventory and submitting them to the interdisciplinary and inter-sectorial National Climate Committee (NCC), led by the activities and measures to adapt to climate change and mitigate GHG emissions. High members of the NCC. However, due to frequent changes in the Government, so far this Committee was not able to function as it was intended initially. There is a plan to create consistent with the new Government structure. In 2016 given the importance of climate change adaptation and GHG mitigation, the 28manage the implementation of the commitments and duties under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, and to integrate climate change related issues in other development programmes.the Nature Conservation Fund (name has changed as Environment and Climate Fund since 2017) engaging experienced professionals to facilitate smooth implementation of commitments under UNFCCC. The CCPIU supervised by National focal point for the UNFCCC. There are three sectoral experts to conduct GHG inventory. The Institutional arrangement for climate change is shown in Figure 1-7.Bureau, the National Renewable Energy Center, Ulaanbaatar Municipality, and National Figure 1-7: Institutional arrangement for climate change activitiesNational Renewable Energy Center, and the Clean Air Foundation. The National Agency 29for Meteorology and Environment Monitoring (NAMEM) monitors the environment and climate, carrying out a range of climate change studies and research. In addition, the government is promoting activities to raise public awareness of climate change and its impacts through professional and civil society communities and media.BUR Implementation Arrangement The preparation of GHG inventory, national communications and Biennial Update Report the MET appoints a project manager to undertake day to day coordination of the project. Figure 1-8: The First BUR implementation arrangementFor the improvement of the data collection and quality of GHG estimation, during the preparation of BUR, the MET of Mongolia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) The Government of Mongolia is continuously striving to improve national GHG estimation 30continuous improvement in national reporting, Government of Mongolia has made A number of institutions were engaged to conduct various studies for BUR, including those that especially carry out studies to identify constraints and gaps and related needed and received.1.3 Financial, Technology and Capacity Needs According to decision 2/CP.17, non-Annex I Parties are to provide updated information and technical support received from the Global Environment Facility, Parties included in Annex II to the Convention and other developed country Parties, the Green Climate Fund and multilateral institutions for activities relating to climate change, including for the preparation of the current BUR.Accordingly, this chapter presents information on the need for continued reporting of the TNC as the needs remain largely relevant for the present reporting as well.National Greenhouse Gas InventoryCHAPTER 2322. NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY2.1 National Greenhouse Gas Inventory System2.1.1 Overview of institutional arrangements for compiling GHG inventory authority shall estimate the emissions and removals of GHGs for Mongolia following the methodologies approved by the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) of Mongolia is the key ministry to develop, update and implement climate related policies. Thus, the MET and its ﬁClimate Change and for organizing and coordinating the compilation of National Communications, Biennial the National focal point for the UNFCCC. In order to facilitate smooth implementation of commitments under UNFCCC, the MET established climate change project implementation unit (CCPIU) at the Environment and Climate Fund (ECF) under the ministry. The CCPIU is also supervised by National focal point for the UNFCCC.The inventory team of CCPIU, which consists of three sectorial experts, with the cooperation of relevant ministries, agencies and organizations, prepares the national GHG inventory and compiles supplementary information. Figure 2-1 shows the overall institutional arrangement for Mongolia™s inventory preparation. More detailed information on the role and responsibility of relevant ministries, agencies and organizations in the inventory preparation process is described in the Table 2-1. Figure 2-1: Institutional arrangement for the GHG inventory compilation of Mongolia332.1.2 Overview of inventory preparation and management As described above, the Mongolia™s GHG inventory preparation system/institutional arrangement is not well developed, but in the near future it is planned to establish a national system for sustainable inventory preparation. Currently the preparation of national GHG inventory is centralized and is being compiled at CCPIU of ECF under the ministry. The improvement should be made in the near future is the decentralization of the inventory preparation process in terms of required activity data, and distribute the responsibilities of individual sectors fully under the external institutions and sectorial experts. Under the distribution of responsibilities can be understood through activity data collection and its analysis on continuous basis, and provide activity data to GHG inventory team at CCPIU, so that the GHG inventory can be compiled. The main source of were used such as International Energy Agency (IEA), Food and Agriculture Organization in order to complete the time series. The national system for sustainable inventory preparation is utmost important for the continuous, robust and decentralized preparation of a national GHG inventory. The next table provides more detailed information about the current preparation process of national GHG inventory. The GHG inventory team consists of three specialists of CCPIU, of each responsible for energy and IPPU, AFOLU, and waste sectors.

greenhouse gas inventories Mongolia has signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 12ththth1999. Mongolia is a developing country and as a non-Annex I Party, are not obligated to reduce its GHG emissions under the regulations of KP, but under the Paris Agreement (PA), Mongolia has set its targets to reduce GHG emissions compared to business as usual (BAU) scenario until 2030. Mongolia™s National Inventory Report (NIR) has been prepared as a part of its initial Biennial Update Report (iBUR). The NIR contains updated accounts of net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimate for the period of 1990-2014. The GHG inventory for the NIR has been compiled using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas inventories (IPCC 2006). But the NIR has been prepared according to UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of biennial update reporting for Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 40 and annex III of decision 2/CP.17). 1. This inventory was updated 2, a regional of preparation of the Mongolia™s initial National Communication (GEF/UNEP), the GHG inventories were updated to 1998 for the third time. In accordance with the preparation been compiled for the period 1990-2006. Generally the Tier 1 method of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (revised IPCC 1996) was used  for all sectors except some subcategories of energy and agriculture (enteric fermentation). The country In scope of the preparation of initial BUR (iBUR) and Third National Communication (TNC), the national GHG inventories have been compiled using the IPCC 2006 and its Tier 1 and obligated to use IPCC 2006, Mongolia decided to change the GHG inventories estimation method to the IPCC 2006.Previous GHG inventory results have been reported as part of the National Communications (NCs). For the BUR Mongolia has prepared the NIR to present GHG inventory results. 1-omies in transition in meeting their obligations under the UNFCCC.2preparation of GHG inventories, help to identify GHG abatement options, and prepare a portfolio of abate-ment projects for each country. (https://www.adb.org/publications/series/asia-least-cost-greenhouse-gas-abatement-strategy-algas) 17The preparation of NIR is not only meant to serve the purpose of meeting international report obligations, but it provides the basis for setting up a national emissions reduction institutional arrangement, GHG inventory system and capacity building. Greenhouse gases coveredThe inventory covers sources of GHG emissions which results from anthropogenic activities for direct GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), indirect GHGs such as nitrogen oxides (NOx(HFCs) and their removals by sinks. Net emissions have been presented in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs)3Sectors covered The GHG inventory has been conducted for key economic sectors that support Mongolia™s economic development. The emissions/removals have been estimated from four sectors and product use, (3) Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) and (4) Waste. 1.2 General description of the institutional arrangement for GHG inventory preparation 1.2.1 Overview of institutional arrangement for compiling GHG inventory authority shall estimate the emissions and removals of GHGs of Mongolia following the methodologies approved by the Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCCﬂ. The Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) of Mongolia is the key ministry to develop, update and implement climate related policies. Thus, the MET and its Climate with overall responsibility for organizing and coordinating the compilation of National Communications, Biennial updated reports, GHG inventory and submitting them to the In order to facilitate smooth implementation of commitments under UNFCCC, the MET established climate change project implementing unit (CCPIU) at the Environment and Climate Fund (ECF) under the ministry. The CCPIU is also supervised by National focal point for the UNFCCC.The inventory team of CCPIU, which consists of three sectorial experts, with the cooperation of relevant ministries, agencies and organizations, prepares national GHG inventory and compiles supplementary information.  32, 21=CH4, 310=N2-able. However they were reported but are not included in the inventory total.  18Figure 1-1 shows the overall institutional arrangement for Mongolia™s inventory prepara-tion. More detailed information on the role and responsibility of relevant ministries, agen-cies and organizations in the inventory preparation process is described in the Table 1-1. Figure 1-1: Institutional arrangement for the GHG inventory compilation of Mongolia1.2.2 Overview of inventory preparation and management Currently, the preparation of national GHG inventory is centralized and is being compiled at CCPIU of ECF under the ministry. The main source of activity data is the National Additional statistics from international sources were used such as the International Energy assumptions were made for unavailable activity data in order to complete the time series. Table 1-1 provides more detailed information about the current preparation process of national GHG inventory. The GHG inventory team consists of three specialists of CCPIU, of each responsible for energy and IPPU, AFOLU, and waste sectors.

The reason  for using the IPCC 2006 is that, the guidelines include updated methods and improved default values. GHG emissions estimates have been made in accordance with the IPCC 2006 methods. In general Tier 1 IPCC method was applied. However there were selected categories such as fuel combustion and fugitive emissions from solid fuels, LULUCF for which Tier 2 method was used. 201.3.1 Methods of estimation The methodology for Mongolia™s GHG inventory has seen some improvements towards a combination of Tier 1 and Tier 2 estimation methods that  causes shift from the revised IPCC 1996 to the IPCC 2006 and uncertainty assessment. An overview of the methods and EFs applied for the calculations of the emissions is presented in Table 1-2.

QA/QC activities on the inventory are undertaken within the framework of this QA/QC plan. The overall aim of QA/QC plan is to maintain and improve the quality in all stages of the inventory work. The QA/QC procedures represent the main instrument for continuous improvement in subsequent inventory cycles. The QA/QC plan guides the process of ensuring inventory quality by describing data and methodology checks, developing processes governing peer review and public comments, and developing guidance on conducting an analysis of the uncertainty surrounding the emission estimates. The QA/QC procedures also include feedback loops and provide for corrective actions that are designed to improve the inventory estimates over time. calculation (the GHG emissions calculation has been done by the 2006 IPCC Inventory including the QC for the EFs and other parameters as well.  The main source of activity data of GHG emissions estimation is the National statistics organizations/institutions and producers by questionnaires at national level. For the QC/private organizations/institutions in order to compare and ensure with the data from institutions. The IPCC 2006 recommends that if there  is  availability of several sources of data was used for the inventory. Focus group meetings were organized to be agreed on assumptions made  from calculations. Expert peer reviews are commissioned to provide inventory, CRF tables are made prior to approval. 1.6 General uncertainty evaluationThe uncertainty estimate of the 2014 inventory has been done according to the Tier 1 method presented by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006). Tier 1 method combines the uncertainty in activity rates and EFs, for each source category and GHG, and then aggregates these uncertainties for all sources of categories and GHGs to obtain the total uncertainty for the inventory. 25In many cases, uncertainty values have been assigned based on default uncertainty estimates according to IPCC guidelines or expert judgement  due to lack of the information. The uncertainty analysis was done for the sectors: energy, IPPU, AFOLU and waste sectors. The base year for assessment of uncertainty in trend is 1990 and the assessment has been done until 2014. The results of the uncertainty analysis for all sectors have been presented in Annex III. 1.7 General assessment of the completeness 1.7.1 Sectors (sources and sinks)All sources/removals of direct and indirect GHGs associated with activities occurring in Mongolia were covered in GHG inventory including the following activities where there were data available and emissions estimated.

Thus this is a new inventory with new methodology, updated activity data and EFs rather than recalculations. Trends in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) EmissionsCHAPTER 2302.1 Description and interpretation of emission trends for aggregated GHG emissions The main sources of GHG emissions have been divided into the following sectors: Energy (CRF 1), Industrial processes and Product Use (IPPU, CRF 2), Agriculture (CRF 3), Land use, Total GHG emissions in Mongolia in 2014 were 34,482.73 Gg CO2e (excluding LULUCF). 2increase from the 2013 level with 32,687.27 Gg CO2e. Net GHG emissions in 2014 were 10,030.80 Gg CO2e (including LULUCF). This represented a 1,034.44% increase from the 1990 level of -1,073.46 Gg CO2e and 23.23% increase from the 2013 level with 8,139.60 Gg CO2e (Figure 2-1 and Table 2-1).Figure 2-1: Mongolia™s total and net GHG emissions and removals, 1990-2014 (Gg CO2e)In general, emissions and removals from each sector are increased in 2014 compared values of each GHG inventory sectors.

The average annual growth rates of then growth rate increased gradually in energy sector, while in IPPU sector it is increased populations. Livestock population were dropped rapidly during 2000-2002 and 2009-2010 due to harsh winter. In the waste sector, GHG growth rate is gradually increasing from 1996 to 2014 due to an increase in urban population.

The total GHG emissions of IPPU sector in 2014 increased base year 1990. The emission are linked with the economic situation of the country. The GHG emissions increased in 2014 by 37.72% compared to 2013. The main contributor to the total emissions from IPPU sector is the mineral industry (cement and lime production) and it represents 68.86% of the total emissions.  Cement and lime are  important ingredients for building materials for production. The building material industry is growing in parallel with the population as well as the economy (see Figure 2-6).2.2.4 WasteThe waste sector is an emissions and contributes to only 0.46% of the national total. However, GHG emissions have increased continuously year after year in relation to the population growth especially in urban areas.

Availability of data for LULUCF inventory is still lacking. It should be noted that only forest land remaining forest land category is reported under Land category for this submission (Figure 2-8). 2.3 Description and interpretation of emission trends by gasesThe most important GHG in Mongolia is carbon dioxide (CO2) (without LULUCF) accounting for 46.41% of the national total in 2014. The CO2 emissions primarily result from fuel combustion activities. Methane (CH4), which mainly arises from enteric fermentation of livestock and solid waste disposals contribute for 32.89% to the national total GHG emissions, and nitrous oxide (N2O) from agricultural soils contributes for 20.42% to the blowing equipment usage contributes to the remaining 0.28% in 2014. The trend of CO2, CH4 and N2be found from Chapters 2.3.1-2.3.4. The data on HFCs which are mostly emitted from the use of these gases in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment were available from 2012. The consumption data of for introduction of low GWP alternatives in Mongoliaﬂ. More details about HFCs can be found below in Chapter 3.2 Industrial processes and product use.

The main source of CO2 emissions in Mongolia is  fossil fuel combustion. Within the fuel combustion category, the energy industries is the most important sub-source with the to CO2 emissions is the manufacturing industries and construction source category with  2.3.2  Methane (CH4)CH4 emissions increased from 6,872.62 to 11,341.60 Gg CO2from 1990 to 2014. The main sources  for CH4 emission in Mongolia are the enteric fermentation in agriculture sector, the fugitive emissions from coal mining and handling, 372.3.3 Nitrous oxide (N2O)N22e for the period 1990-2014, which is 69.63% increase over the years. The main sources are: direct N2O emissions from managed soils; indirect N2O emissions from managed soils; energy industries; manufacturing industries and construction; transport and residential sectors, and domestic wastewater treatment and discharge. s)The activity data for the estimation of HFCs emissions were available only from 2012 to substitutes,  emissions are increasing with the growing consumption of applications. For the emissions estimation  for HFCs Tier 1 method of IPCC 2006 was used which  used the default emission factors. The Tier 1 method then back-calculates the development of banks of a refrigerant from the current reporting year to the year of its introduction. The year of introduction for HFC-134a (mobile air conditioning) was 2007. Thus the emissions have been calculated for the period 2007-2014 and increased remarkably for this period from 3.17 to 96.43Gg CO2e due to growth of imported refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.  2.4 Description and interpretation of emission trends for indirect GHGs Emission estimates for NOx and CO are reported in the CRF as well. This chapter summarizes the trends for these gases. The following table shows the indirect gas emissions from mainly the AFOLU sector for the years of 1990 and 2014.

Energy (CRF 1)CHAPTER 3403.1 Overview of the sector The energy sector of GHG inventory (GHGI) in Mongolia covers two main source categories, namely fuel combustion (CRF 1.A) and fugitive emissions (CRF 1.B). Within the fuel combustion source category, it had estimated emissions from energy industries (electricity generation, combined heat and power generation), manufacturing industries and construction (in aggregated manner), transport (civil aviation, road transportation, railways), other sectors (commercial/institutional, residential, agriculture/forestry), non-production). This sector is the main contributor to overall GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) with its share of 62.34% and 17,267.79 Gg of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) in 2014. The Figure 3-1 below shows the share of each sector in the total GHG emissions excluding LULUCF from the year 2014. Figure 3-1: The share of each sector in total GHG emissions of Mongolia (excl. LULUCF), 2014Within the energy sector, energy industries contribute the most percentage to the GHG emissions and next two contributors are manufacturing industries and construction, energy industries is relatively constant, e.g. from 46.97% in 1990 increased up to 68.09% and gradually increased up to 13.40% in 2014. This change is linked to the consequences of transition from  planned to the market economy in the late 90s. In addition to fuel combustion,  pollution from small sources of residential heating systems and fugitive methane emissions from solid fuel transmission/transport/distribution contribute 2e in 1990 to 17,267.8 Gg CO2e in 2014.  41Table 3-1: GHG emissions from energy sector by source categories, Gg CO2eCategoriesEmissions199019952000200520102014Energy IndustriesGg7,110.129,474.70%46.9768.0963.68Manufacturing Industries and ConstructionGg1,792.04716.301,888.932,313.48%22.8620.097.3614.2813.40TransportGg1,439.661,108.73%12.9812.4211.38Other Sectors*Gg1,164.36646.361,221.031,690.481,422.37%12.788.24Gg611.38421.83148.07333.48903.37%4.731.973.42Fugitive emissions from fuels (coal, oil)Gg130.9191.80101.42680.31%1.181.031.626.70Energy TotalGg11,091.148,920.669,738.3017,267.79%100.00100.00100.00100.00100.00100.00* Other sectors include Commercial/Institutional, Residential and Agriculture/Forestry/Fishing source categories.

Mongolia has about 8 imports about 20% of its annual electricity demand mainly from Russia and to a lesser extent, from China. In the year of 2016 Mongolia™s energy production has increased by 2.98% from previous years (ERC, 2016). of road and transport development, Ministry of mining and heavy industry, and the Mongolian civil aviation authority. International sources such as International Energy therefore with the help of additional statistics and various assumptions some data were disaggregated and supplemented in the respective sectors of energy transformation and for transport sectors, the gasoline and diesel consumption for respective vehicle types were taken  and imported to the amount of these fuels. Total aggregated emissions from fuel combustion, including transport, based on sectorial approach represented 16,111.16 Gg of CO2e in 2014. The following Table 3-3 gives an overview of emission sources. 45Table 3-3: Emission sources for the disaggregation of the energy balanceBalance of emission sources Emission sources are: public combined heat and power plants (CHPs),hard coal mining, brown coal mining,heat only boilers (HOBs),small diesel power plants,Ulaanbaatar railways (UBTZ),Mongolian railways, Mongolian airlines (MIAT),other mining and manufacturing industries, household stoves,vehicles,Plant types are:combined heat and power plants (CHPs),steam turbine power plants, diesel power plants,heat only boilers (HOBs), According to energy sources: coal: coking coal, other bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal, lignite, diesel oil,from International Energy Agency (IEA) statistics were used. The Ministry of Energy development of the energy balance table of Mongolia. manufacturing industries and construction (CRF 1.A.2) category the liquid (diesel oil) and In the transport category (CRF 1.A.3) as well as the activity data like fuel consumption data of road transportation was unavailable to disaggregate by vehicle types nationwide, therefore the activity data were taken as the sum consumption of motor gasoline and diesel oil. The distinction of jet fuel consumption between international and domestic aviation was relatively complicated due to lack of activity data from the Ministry of and Mongolian Civil Aviation Authority (MCAA). Therefore the jet fuel consumption of into the diesel oil consumption for locomotives and coal (mostly sub-bituminous coal) consumption for passenger wagon heating (only in heating season, which lasts almost 7 months). Other sectors (CRF 1.A.4) include the fuel consumption in commercial and institutional, subcategory  coal, diesel oil and other primary solid biomass were consumed by stationary 463.2.2 Feedstock and non-energy use of fuels For a number of applications, mainly in larger industrial processes, fossil hydrocarbons are not only used as energy sources, but also have other uses e.g. feedstock, lubricants, solvents, etc. The sectorial approaches (Tier 1, 2 and 3) are therefore based on fuel combustion statistics. In the case of Mongolia, the lubricants use has been reported in the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sector under non-energy products from fuels and solvent use sector. 3.2.3 Fugitive emissions from solid fuels (CRF 1.B)In Mongolia, the fugitive emissions from fuels occur in the coal mining and handling, fugitive emissions from fuels were calculated from the surface mining industry, because the underground mines are not occurring in Mongolia. The crude oil production has started from 1996 in Mongolia,  back then, the amount of explored oil was around 2 thousand cubic meters and in 2014 was 1.2 million cubic (MRPAM, 2017).  The overview of total fugitive emissions from fuels has been presented in the following Figure 3-4: Total fugitive emissions from fuels for the period 1990-201447fugitive emissions from coal mining and handling were relatively constant until 2011 and further have been slightly declining. On the contrary, the fugitive emissions from oil production have risen steadily. Over the years the share of fugitive emissions from solid fuels represent 64% and from crude oil 36%. 3.2.4 International aviation bunkers (CRF 1.A.3.a)This category includes emissions from the international aviation (CRF 1.A.3.a.i). These emissions are excluded from the national totals. thMongolia remains committed to the strategic objectives of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with respect to its goal of enhancing the global aviation safety and impacts from air transport and strengthening the laws governing civil aviation. Mongolia™s air transport industry is focusing on passenger and air cargo markets. Air passenger transport is the most important aviation activity and counts 340,024 passengers has actually declined in the domestic market since 1993 (in total 8.6% by 2012), it has been increased more than seven times in the international market in that same period. As of 2012, there are twenty-two airports (except only one international and others are domestic) in Mongolia, three of them are private airports and nineteen airports are Chinggis Khaan International Airport is the only  international airport in Mongolia, but from 2013  a Mongolian-Japanese joint project to build a New Ulaanbaatar International 2013). fugitive emissions from fuels over the years 1990-201448The Mongolian Civil Aviation Authority (MCAA) has an overall responsibility for the aviation sector in Mongolia. The GHG emissions from international aviation bunkers can be seen from the Figure 3-6. Figure 3-6: GHG emissions from international aviation bunkers for the period 1990-2014From the trend of GHG emissions in international aviation bunkers can be seen two major rises and declines. On the one hand along the economic growth and downturn in - Eznis Airways LLC was established on January 6th 2006 with the investment of Newcom Group which is one the biggest groups in Mongolia, and imported the increased. - In 2006 total passenger transportation increased by 16% than previous year. The sharp decline from 2008 to 2009 caused by: - World economic downturn,- Increase of fuel prices, aircraft and was suspended in 2009, According to IPCC 2006 the Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods use fuel consumption data. Tier 1 is In the case of Mongolia, the jet fuel consumption and sold data were not available for the period of 1990-2014. Therefore the number of LTOs has been used for the GHG emissions from jet fuel consumption. 49with the numbers of imported jet fuel amount and this way the fuel consumption for international and domestic aviation has been estimated. The one of two jet fuel trading companies the A-Jet Limited LLC was founded in 2004, with the activity operations such as crude oil (incl. jet fuel) imports and activities in agricultural and mining sectors. The activity data request from A-Jet Limited LLC on jet fuel sold was requested for the period 1990-2014, but we received data for the period 2004-2014. For the remaining years 1990-2003 there are 14 years to estimate missing years with a long term extrapolation which is not a good practice. Thus after a consultation with experts, the fuel consumption for international and domestic aviation. The overview of the jet fuel consumption and GHG emissions during 1990-2014 is presented in the Table 3-4. 2014YearJet keroseneConsumptionGHG emissions(kt)CO2 (t)CH4 (t)N2O (t)CO2e (t)19900.30.006619910.72,207.210.06172,226.6719921.02,837.840.01980.07942,862.8619931.02,837.840.01980.07942,862.8619942.77,882.882.99,144.140.06399,224.7719960.4939199710.834,369.340.24030.961434,672.41199830,900.870.21610.864431,173.3619996.922,702.6822,902.8820008.30.18300.732126,401.93200110.432,792.760.22930.917333,081.9320028.727,432.410.19180.767327,674.3120037.623,963.940.16760.670320048.30.18300.732126,401.938.10.17860.7144200619.10.42121.6846200716.70.36821.472950200814.244,774.730.313120097.222,702.6822,902.8820106.90.6086201110.232,162.130.22490.8996201213.20.29111.164241,988.6120131.4024201413.41.181942,624.803.3 Comparison of the Sectorial Approach (SA) with the Reference Approach (RA)In the context of international climate protection, the reporting on fuel combustion related CO2 emissions due to the dominant share of the total emissions are of the utmost importance. The Reference Approach (RA) is a top-down approach, using a country™s energy supply data to calculate the CO2 emissions from mainly fossil fuels combustion. The RA is a straightforward method that can be applied on the basis of relatively easily available energy supply statistics. Excluded carbon has increased the requirements for data to some extent. However, improved comparability between the sectorial and reference approaches continues to allow a country to produce a second independent estimate of CO2(IPCC, 2006). The RA is designed to calculate the emissions of CO2 from fuel combustion, starting from high level of energy supply data. The assumption is that carbon is conserved so that, for example, carbon in crude oil is equal to the total carbon content of all the derived energy sector and only total CO2 emissions from source category of fuel combustion (CRF 1.A) (IPCC, 2006). The RA has been executed for all inventory years from 1990 until 2014. The basis for this consumption, but in the case of Mongolia it is provided by coal balances of national and IEA statistics.  3-7 2 Based on the IPCC methodology, RA in apparent consumption of fuels was estimated after consideration of carbon stored in iron and steel industry. 5122the period 1990-2014YearTOTAL FUELSApparent Energy ConsumptionCO2 emissions RASARASA(TJ)(TJ)%CO2 (Gg)CO2 (Gg)%1990137,312.4211,234.824.911991-1.6212,674.821.071992129,027.17130,890.31-1.4211,079.6710,937.801.301993121,033.16-1.4810,272.9310,147.221.241994106,627.62107,239.719,096.138,863.872.62106,608.771.179,106.818,682.224.89199691,116.1991,288.07-0.197,400.604.87199789,902.217,339.206,883.866.62199889,870.64-0.807,293.796,990.164.34199991,211.791.347,416.736,948.196.7420000.227,680.287,286.77200194,297.0494,422.40-0.137,277.094.842002100,371.09-0.488,114.027,773.664.382003-1.273.392004101,319.19-0.267,814.704.36-0.729,346.902.612006134,124.80-3.07-6.472007137,020.33139,987.17-2.1211,404.37-3.332008137,672.49-1.7311,007.4411,349.22-3.01522009142,888.66-0.79-0.2120100.3012,342.640.732011166,012.17167,091.6313,620.9413,691.492012184,084.79-0.622013201,480.460.4916,363.232014193,882.9316,644.69Table 3-6: The comparison of solid fuel consumption and CO2the period 1990-2014YearSOLID FUELSApparent Energy ConsumptionCO2 emissions RASARASA(TJ)(TJ)%CO2 (Gg)CO2 (Gg)%1990103,863.39102,981.120.868,294.871991126,006.22-1.9310,906.3210,772.061992110,277.96112,141.10-1.669,730.791.48199399,974.42-1.828,483.061.49199490,972.87-0.677,967.273.0191,272.1290,036.041.378,008.371996-0.2319976,229.107.89199873,111.1473,833.48-0.986,094.221999200076,368.390.286,367.222001-0.1720026,688.16200377,618.38-1.634.27200477,180.346,083.6291,281.7292,109.38-0.903.192006-3.848,429.23-7.832007103,693.08-2.788,630.689,009.91-4.212008104,380.33-2.768,406.76-4.272009-1.029,380.12-0.262010116,974.110.399,833.499,742.800.932011123,933.24-0.8710,493.72-0.662012134,888.1911,497.96-0.72201312,886.371.88201413,133.017.1453Table 3-7: The comparison of liquid fuel consumption and CO2the period 1990-2014YearLIQUID FUELSApparent Energy ConsumptionCO2 emissions RASARASA(TJ)(TJ)%CO2 (Gg)CO2 (Gg)%199033,449.0333,449.030.002,413.482,414.08-0.03199124,381.9624,381.960.001,768.98-0.03199218,749.2118,749.210.001,348.881,349.18-0.02199322,882.4922,882.490.001,663.681,664.16-0.0319940.001,128.861,129.11-0.020.001,098.44-0.02199616,049.2916,049.290.00-0.0219970.001,110.101,110.33-0.0219980.001,199.80-0.02199916,699.7716,699.770.001,198.221,198.48-0.02200018,383.6118,383.610.001,313.061,313.31-0.02200118,638.8418,638.840.001,334.08-0.0220020.001,426.14-0.02200321,922.3321,922.330.00-0.0220040.001,730.701,731.08-0.0223,627.7823,627.780.001,696.02-0.02200626,879.0326,879.030.001,929.721,930.17-0.0220070.002,393.902,394.46-0.0220081.302,600.681.3120090.00-0.03201034,694.6334,694.630.00-0.0320110.003,127.22-0.03201249,196.6049,196.600.00-0.0320130.003,714.70-0.03201448,612.4848,612.480.00-0.033.4 Methodological issues 3.4.1 Methods used The current submission of Mongolia™s GHG inventory was conducted using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006) and software.

Research report ﬁStudies on 55The previous GHG inventory estimations have been conducted in accordance with revised IPCC 1996 guidelines, but starting with the preparation of iBUR inventory, the team has decided to change the methodology to 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006). The aim of the change is: a) to improve quality of GHG inventory; b) comparability with other countries, c) accuracy and analysis of the activity data, d) choice of default emission factors. consumption of lubricants was calculated under the fuel combustion category, but for this inventory it was calculated under the non-energy products from fuels and solvent inventory which was calculated by using the revised IPCC 1996 are slightly higher than the emissions which was calculated by using IPCC 2006.

For the activity data collection of GHG emissions estimation the questionnaires, in the 56institutions. The IPCC 2006 recommends if there are several sources of the activity data available, it is a good practice to follow the data from national statistics. Especially in this sector the energy balance table and the disaggregation of fuel consumption (e.g. coal disaggregation, liquid fuel disaggregation in the transport source category and jet fuel consumption in international and domestic aviation) is very important. Mongolia does not have a proper energy balance table, but the experts of energy sector is going to develop it in the near future. Mongolia has just started a project with Japan through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Mongolia™s GHG inventory system improvement and capacity building. The duration of the project is from the end of 2017 until early 2020. With the implementation of this project, it is planned to improve the Mongolia™s GHG inventory system, the institutional arrangement of GHG inventory, data collection process, capacity building, and all these issues should be and LULUCF sectors. Industrial Processes and Product Use (CRF 2)CHAPTER 4584.1 Sector overview The GHG emissions from IPPU sector cover emissions estimation from mineral industry (CRF 2.A), metal industry (CRF 2.C), non-energy products from fuels and solvent use (CRF rest of the activities under IPPU sector were excluded from the inventory because they chemical and electronics industries are not occurring in Mongolia. The CO2 and HFCs were the main direct GHGs estimated and reported under IPPU sector. 4.2 Summary of the IPPU sector activities The main contributor to the total emissions from IPPU sector is the mineral industry (cement and lime production). The share of mineral industry in the total GHG emissions of IPPU sector was around 69% in 2014.

In Mongolia there built in 1968 and Khutul cement plant, built in 1982. Both had a wet cement processing technology. In 2014, the Khutul cement plant introduced the dry processing technology and started its operations generating a capacity of 1 million tons of cement per year. From 2008-2009 there was an economic downturn in Mongolia and after this, in 2010 the economy has grown back. 60Figure 4-3: Total GHG emissions from IPPU sector over the years 1990-2014, Gg CO2eTable 4-2: Total GHG emissions from IPPU sector over the years 1990-2014, Gg CO2eYearEmissions, Gg CO2e2.A-Mineral industry2.C-Metal industry2.D-Non-energy products from fuels and solvent use2.F-Product uses as substitutes for ozone depleting substancesTotal IPPU1990206.34012.320218.661991141.9902.240144.231992100.3707.190199364.0806.070199480.9402.77083.7178.62082.81199680.490.24082.26199784.841.820.29019981.300.24084.0919991.47078.41200062.021.040.880200147.880.801.710200287.041.273.71092.03200392.243.14096.97200478.084.391.00083.471.060140.4620060.880139.992007144.606.433.172008164.449.67182.272009132.114.011.7119.732010209.201.776120114.802.832012208.1286.42300.6420134.480.2994.48238.21201496.43328.06Source: GHG Inventory prepared by CCPIU under MET.4.2.1 Mineral Industry (CRF 2.A)The mineral industry of Mongolia covered cement and lime productions. As stated above the share of mineral industry in the IPPU sector was relatively high (94%) from the base year and over the years it has slightly declined (69%) until 2014, because in this year, the shares of other source categories (e.g. metal industry and the use of F-gases)   have increased. Cement and lime production share the emissions of the mineral industry Cement is manufactured from limestone through a closely controlled chemical cement production process, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is heated in a cement kiln 2 in a process known as calcination. Then the lime is combined with silica-containing materials to produce clinker (an intermediate product), with the earlier by-product CO2 being released to the atmosphere. The clinker is then allowed to cool, mixed with a small amount of gypsum and potentially other materials (e.g. slag), and used to make a Portland cement. cement plant which was built in 1968 and Khutul cement plant built in 1982. These two plants used a wet-processing technology for cement production until 2014. From 2014 they shifted the technology from wet- to dry-processing as a result of implementation of Mongolia™s Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Khutul cement plant capacity increased to one million tons of cement per year with the new processing technology. However, Mongolia does not meet its cement demand as shown in the Figure 4-4. Figure 4-4: Cement consumption in thousand tonsSource: GHG Inventory prepared by CCPIU under MET.62The GHG emissions have been estimated not from directly cement production, but from clinker production. The activity data for cement production has been provided by the extraction, clinker and cement production data from producers in thousand tons. The extracted limestone is the main raw material in the clinker production. According to experts of MOI, since the limestone is the main ingredient of clinker, to get a clinker data, limestone should be decreased by 1.6 times. The CO2 emissions from cement (clinker) and lime production can be seen from Table 4-3.

Therefore the emissions have been estimated only for the last few years. For the emissions estimation from HFCs was used Tier 1 method of IPCC 2006 which is using the default emission factors. The Tier 1 method then back-calculates the development of banks of a refrigerant from the current reporting year to the year of its introduction.

The advantages to use latest methodology are e.g.: a) the improvement of country™s GHG inventory, b) comparability with other countries, c) accuracy and analysis of the activity data, d) choice of default emission factors. The changes of GHG emissions estimations from IPPU sector can be explained as follows: from:- CO2 emissions from cement production, - CO2 emissions cast steel and steel bloom production (for metal industry Œ iron and steel production), - HFCs emissions from local and mobile refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, and cars (activity data as imported numbers from national statistics), 2. In this GHG inventory (during iBUR) the GHG emissions have been calculated from:- CO2 emissions from clinker production, - CO2 emissions from steel bloom production (for metal industry Œ iron and steel production),- CO2 emissions from lubricant use (for non-energy products from fuels and solvent use), - HFCs consumption data from the inventory ﬁReport for HFCs inventory and Mongoliaﬂ3 (activity data for consumption of HFCs were available from 2012).The default EFs were used for both emissions calculations.

Agriculture (CRF 3)CHAPTER 5705.1 Overview of sectorThe GHG inventory for the agriculture sector is conducted for three categories: enteric fermentation, manure management, and aggregated sources and non-CO2 emissions on land. The GHG emissions from these three categories were directly dependent on the livestock population in the country. Even though, there are four discrete source categories in the Mongolian agriculture sector as follows: (i) extensive livestock, which is the traditional semi-nomadic pastoral system, where camels, horses, cattle, sheep and goats are grazed together; (ii) mechanized large-area crop production of cereals and fodder crops; (iii) intensive farming, producing potatoes and other vegetables, with both mechanized and simple production methods; and (iv) intensive livestock, with housed dairy cattle, pigs and poultry. The livestock sector dominates, contributing 84.9% of total Mongolia named zud/dzud in which large numbers of livestock die occasionally due to severe, cold winter. In 1999-2000, 2000-2001 and 2001-2002, Mongolia was hit by three thous.heads (8%) animals were lost respectively excluding swine and poultry population number. The second harsh winter within GHG inventory period of 1990-2014 happened in 2009-2010, and over 11 million livestock lost and decreased by circa 26% from previous year™s total.

Mongolia™s animal husbandry has been nomadic pastoralist, with livestock herding on natural pasture, and the amount digested by livestock annually. The emission from enteric fermentation is a key category. Thus, the highest priority of planned improvements could include for livestock source categories. Additionally, Mongolia™s livestock manure is almost 100 percent deposited on pastures and rangelands, thus it tends to decompose under more aerobic conditions and less CH4 is produced and hence detailed research is needed to The emission factors (EFs) of CH4 for enteric fermentation and manure management 76local experts (Namkhainyam et al., 2014). However, in this submission, those developed EFs were not used due to  high uncertainty of the input parameters used.

In 2014, the total emissions from livestock were 9,840.04 Gg CO2e which represented 2e in 1990 to 9,840.04 Gg CO2e in 2014. The observed growing level of emissions was due to rising animal populations. However, there were a two times sharp decrease of the livestock number in 1999-2002 and 2009-2010 due to high number of livestock loss during the harsh winter season named ﬁdzudﬂ explained in the overview of the Agricultural sector section.

The amount of methane that is released depends on the type of digestive tract, age, and weight of the animal, and the quality and quantity of the feed consumed. Ruminant livestock (e.g., cattle, sheep) are major sources of methane with moderate amounts produced from non-ruminant livestock (e.g., pigs, horses). The ruminant gut (rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum) structure fosters extensive enteric fermentation of their diet (IPCC 2006, page 10.24). 5.2.1.2 Summary of emission trends2e making up enteric fermentation between 1990 and 2014 is loss of livestock population during  total methane emissions from enteric fermentation by livestock type. 79swine (0.04%).

The livestock. The emissions level depends on the amount of manure treated and handled within manure management systems and type of manure management systems. The main manure management systems covered by this inventory were: pasture/range/paddock for the cattle, sheep, goats, horses and camels, and daily spread system for the swine and poultry. For  this case, N2O emissions during storage and treatment of these two systems are assumed to be zero and N2O emissions from land application of Mongolian livestock are covered under the Aggregated sources and non-CO2 emissions sources on land (CRF 3.C) source category. Only CH4 is reported under the source category manure management (CRF 3.A.2).  5.2.2.2 Summary of emission trends2e making manure management between 1990 and 2014 is loss of livestock population during  total methane emissions from manure management by livestock type. 82In 1990, cattle contributed 34% of the total emissions from manure management (Figure (3%) and poultry (0.006%).

Table 2.8.2. Thus no overall calculation of uncertainties for HWP estimations is possible.6.1.4 Quality Assurance and Quality ControlIn the current submission all applied information and data have been double-checked as far as possible. The application of methods have been proof-read and follows the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006). The activity data and archived both in hard and electronic copies. For the next submission, an overall quality control and quality assurance system should be in place. This system will describe A recalculation in this category is not done in this submission, due to the implementation time application of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and incorporation of most recent data compared to earlier versions of the Mongolian GHG inventory, the whole inventory can be considered as recalculated.6.1.6 Assessment of completenessThe current LULUCF inventory covers CO2 emissions and removals from 2 source estimation based only on Forest land remaining forest land (CRF 3.B.1.a) source category In the initial BUR of Mongolia (iBUR), it was decided to estimate only biomass of gain and losses on the forest land remaining forest land category, including HWP for the LULUCF sector without land use change (LUC) calculation (Table 6-1). Thus, the removals are may be overestimated or underestimated and further improvements will be needed and to be addressed in further national inventory. There is on-going project to improve the land use assessment  using Collect Earth tool at the Climate Change Project Implementing Program. Current assessment plots are covered all over the Mongolian territory with circa 120,000 grid-plots and aiming to evaluate land use, land use change from 1990 to categories. 99Planned improvements within the LULUCF sector are listed in below Table 6-4.

Further, it is assumed that wood harvest and fuel wood collection only happens on Forest Land Remaining Forest Land.The information of disturbance consolidated the NFI which found 18.60% of the forested area (11.3 million ha) was burned. That results in 2,101,800 ha. Further, it assumed that the was 2,101,800 ha divided by 10 years equals 210,180 ha / year.

The categories and activities for estimation of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are described in detail. The GHG inventory of the waste sector is based on the estimating of methane from solid waste disposal sites, methane emissions from wastewater treatment and discharge, and nitrous oxide from human sewage.The approaches and emission factors employed in estimations of GHG emissions from source categories of the waste sector are presented in Table 7-1. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006) default values are applied in calculations. The selection of methods followed the decision trees in IPCC 2006.

The quantity of CH4 emitted during decomposition process is directly proportional to the park waste, food waste, wood and straw waste.7.2.2.2 Activity data and methane correction factoraccurately determine GHG emissions from the waste sector. The amount of generation of from the urban areas were calculated by multiplying per capita waste generation rates The generation rates were assumed as the follows and it can be divided into three periods:- 1970-1999: 0.334 kg/cap/day1,- 2000-2009: 0.6 kg/cap/day2,- 2010-2014: 0.84 kg/cap/day3Mongolia, 2014ﬂ). The assumption was used for the whole inventory period. Additionally, Ulaanbaatar City in Mongolia by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) was developed. 123technical report 114estimated amount due to illegal disposed wastes that  were collected in Ulaanbaatar for the entire period of 1990 Œ 2014.In 2014, Mongolia™s total urban population was 1,990,320 and 2/3 of the total urban population lives in Ulaanbaatar city. Therefore, it was assumed that approximately 2/3 of the total waste is generated only from Ulaanbaatar city. There are 3 operational controlled waste disposal site, namely Moringiin davaa which started its operation in 1970. Thus, 115to estimate the CH4disposed waste amounts were developed from the 1970s (detailed in Table 7-6).IndicatorsUnits197019801985199019952000200520102014Population thous.person839.0964.21202.31361.271990.32Generated WasteGg66.03102.28298.12610.63Gg42.9266.4876.497.19193.78224.83381.04396.91Biodegradable waste Gg40.49102.7119.16210.36All solid waste disposal sites in Mongolia, in particular in the Ulaanbaatar city, were un-and 8-10 ha areas are processing annually on these sites. Thus, calculations made under solid waste disposal comprise of managed as well as un-managed disposal sites. The solid waste disposal sites in Mongolia fall into the un-managed shallow type according to IPCC guidelines before 2009 and then divided un-managed and managed type from  2010. Based on this national circumstance, the methane correction factor (MCF) was chosen estimation between 1970 and 2009.

It is a good practice to treat the three categories: rural population, urban-high income population, and urban-low income population separately.Mongolia administratively is divided into the capital Ulaanbaatar, 21 provinces called aimag, and aimags into soums. Therefore, population of Ulaanbaatar city was considered as an urban high income group, population of 21 provinces as urban low income group and population of soums as rural group.

The IPCC default of 0.6 kg CH44122system that serves the apartment area and a very small proportion of the ger areas. The main water treatment plant is the central wastewater treatment plant which has a capacity of 170,000 m3 per day. The volume of wastewater now far exceeds the physical and technical capacity of these plants which have obsolete technical equipment dating from the socialist era. As a result 170,000 to 190,000m3 of improperly treated wastewater is discharged into the Tuul River daily. As reported above, 2/3 of the total urban population lives in Ulaanbaatar. Therefore, methane correction factor for centralized aerobic treatment plant default IPCC value of 0.3 was used for emission calculations.Methane conversion factors (MCFs) were applied depending on the treatment type and level. The IPCC default values were used as a source of MCF value. However, expert judgment was performed to choose values applicable for Mongolian conditions (Table 7-14).Table 7-14: MCF values applied depending on type and level of treatmentType of treatment or dischargeMaximum Methane Producing Capacity, B0Methane Correction Factor, MCFjEmission Factor,EFj(kg CH4/kg BOD)( - )(kg CH4/kg BOD)Centralized aerobic treatment plant 0.60.30.18Latrine  0.60.10.060.60.3In the case of Mongolian, even in the capital city and other main cities, wastewater treatment facilities do not have an operational device for the methane recovery or gas of big cities including Ulaanbaatar city has installed methane recovery devices and those are never used due to the lack of human capacity and later all of them became out of use6.   Therefore, for amount of methane recovered default IPCC value of zero was used for emission calculations.N2O EmissionsThe N2O emissions from industrial wastewater have been calculated using the IPCC Tier N2O emissions from wastewater domestic sources for the period 1990-2014 are shown in Figure 7-9. The total amount of N2O emission from domestic wastewater treatment in 2014 was 0.07 Gg.

CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater treatment for Figure 79: CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater treatment, by industrial outputs125Fluctuations in aggregated methane emissions from industrial wastewater treatment and discharge could be explained with changes of economic situation. Meanwhile, some been reduced due to closure of some light industries (Figure 7-9).7.3.3.2 Methodological issues CH4 EmissionsThe CH4 emissions from industrial wastewater have been calculated using the IPCC Tier 1 methodology proposed by IPCC 2006. Assessment of CH4 production potential from industrial wastewater streams is based on the concentration of degradable organic matter follows:- meat processing (slaughterhouse)- alcohol production- beer production- dairy products - wine production- vegetable oil production.outputs were reported in cubic meters, therefore converted units from cubic meters to tons by using the density of alcohol, wine, beer, dairy products were taken as 0.789 kg/l, 0.9983 kg/l, 1.01 kg/l, 1.028 kg/l respectively. The data of degradable organic component and wastewater produced for per ton and other sources.

Uncertainty in the emission estimates of wastewater treatment and discharge arises from uncertainties in activity data and emission factors. The IPCC recommended default values were used as the source for uncertainty values. However, expert judgment was performed to choose values applicable for GHG emission calculations from wastewater treatment and discharge are presented in Table 7-20. The time series was checked for its consistency.
